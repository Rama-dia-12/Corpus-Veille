Pd-based automotive exhaust control catalysts, especially Pd-based three-way catalysts (TWCs), have received considerable research attention owing to its prominent oxidation activity of HCs/CO, as well as excellent thermal stability. For Pd-based TWCs, the dispersion, chemical state and thermal stability of Pd species, which are crucial to the catalytic performance, are closely associated with interactions between metal nanoparticles and their supporting matrix. Progress on the research about MSI and utilization of MSI in advanced Pd-based three-way catalysts are reviewed here. Along with the development of advanced synthesis approaches and engine control technology, the study on MSI would play a notable role in further development of catalysts for automobile exhaust control.

In particular, a detailed unit commitment model has been developed based on mixed-integer programming techniques incorporating energy storage systems with both charging and discharging options, electric vehicles with both grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid modes, and demand response programs for cost-optimal energy and ancillary services scheduling. The balancing services considered include Frequency Containment Reserves (FCR), automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves (aFRR), and manual Frequency Restoration Reserves (mFRR), in both upward and downward directions. The impact of all these flexibility providers on operational and economic aspects has been assessed through an illustrative case study of a power system with high penetration of renewable energy sources, including thermal and hydroelectric power units. The results highlight the superiority of results when considering the participation of all flexibility providers, especially in the ancillary services market, in terms of economic competitiveness, renewable energy curtailment, associated CO 2 emissions, and utilization of costly energy resources.

One state level effort is a plan from California to mandate that all new passenger vehicle sales are EVs by 2035. Using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, we analyze the potential air quality impacts of having varying amounts of EVs in the California fleet for a historical (2016) and a future (2028) year, with emphasis on ozone (O 3) and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5). We find that for both PM 2.5 and O 3 , reductions in concentrations scale approximately linearly with increasing EV fleet turnover. Improvements in air quality are widespread throughout the state, with the largest improvements occurring near Los Angeles and throughout the Central Valley. With full electrification of onroad vehicle fleets, the statewide population-weighted annual average PM 2.5 concentration is reduced by about 0.5 g/m3 for both 2016 and 2028. Reductions in state population-weighted average fourth highest MDA8 O 3 are 6.6 ppb and 4.3 ppb for 2016 and 2028. The results indicate that there are air quality benefits, and thus health benefits, to be gained from the transition to EVs and that these benefits do not diminish with increasing rates of EV adoption.

China has released various regulations and standards to address pollution from mobile and stationary sources. Thus, it is urgent to develop online monitoring technology for atmospheric pollution source emissions. This study provides an overview of the main progress in mobile and stationary source monitoring technology in China and describes the comprehensive application of some typical instruments in vital areas in recent years. These instruments have been applied to monitor emissions from motor vehicles, ships, airports, the chemical industry, and electric power generation. Not only has the level of atmospheric environment monitoring technology and equipment been improving, but relevant regulations and standards have also been constantly updated. Meanwhile, the developed instruments can provide scientific assistance for the successful implementation of regulations. According to the potential problem areas in atmospheric pollution in China, some research hotspots and future trends of atmospheric online monitoring technology are summarized.

Compilation of a mobile source emission inventory is conducive to the analysis of pollution emission characteristics and the formulation of emission reduction policies. This study summarizes the latest compilation approaches and data acquisition methods for mobile source emission inventories. For motor vehicles, a high-resolution emission inventory can be developed based on a bottom-up approach with a refined traffic flow model and real-world speed-coupled emission factors. The top-down approach has advantages when dealing with macroscale vehicle emission estimation without substantial traffic flow infrastructure. For nonroad mobile sources, nonroad machinery, inland river ships, locomotives, and civil aviation aircraft, a top-down approach based on fuel consumption or power is adopted. For ocean-going ships, a bottom-up approach based on automatic identification system (AIS) data is adopted. Three typical cases are studied, including emission reduction potential, a cost-benefit model, and marine shipping emission control. Outlooks and suggestions are given on future research directions for emission inventories for mobile sources: building localized emission models and factor databases, improving the dynamic updating capability of emission inventories, establishing a database of emission factors of unconventional pollutants and greenhouse gas from mobile sources, and establishing an urban high temporal-spatial resolution volatile organic compound (VOC) evaporation emission inventory.

To tackle the same in such a system, coordinated frequency and voltage control with appropriate control strategy have been investigated in this work considering a single area independent hybrid system. A combined solar gas turbine, solar chimney, and biodiesel-operated generator along with hybrid electric vehicles and refrigerators as the thermostatic load are used to model the hybrid system. Constraints of the proposed cascaded PI-TID controller are finely tuned with the recently developed DBOA. Coordinated frequency and voltage control of a combined solar gas turbine-solar chimney with thermostatic loads in an isolated hybrid microgrid system have not been reported earlier. Furthermore, the application of DBOA to tune a cascaded PI-TID controller for coordinated control of voltage and frequency is a novel approach.

For an objective analysis of microgrids with large grid parity of renewable energy sources, probabilistic methods are required along with the already established deterministic methods. A Gauss quadrature-based probabilistic load flow (GQPLF) method for microgrid has been proposed along with intermittent generation and uncertain loads, including electric vehicles (EVs). The distributed generation consists of wind turbine generation systems (WTGS) and photovoltaic systems (PVs) connected to 14 bus microgrid systems with six droop-controlled distributed generators. Extensive simulations have been carried out on a 14-bus microgrid with distributed generation and uncertain loads, and results are compared with the benchmark Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method, which validates the efficacy of the proposed method. The time taken by the proposed GQPLF for the 14-bus microgrid system simulation is 60.9 seconds, which is significantly less compared to the benchmark Monte Carlo simulation method, in which time taken for a 14-bus microgrid system with 10,000 simulations is 9318.7 seconds. Comparing the proposed GQPLF method with the benchmark method validates its efficacy and efficiency.

Moreover, the MG energy management with high RE penetration faces complicate uncertainties due to the inaccuracy of predictions. Besides, the growing participation of electric vehicles (EVs) makes the traditional model-based methods even more infeasible. Considering uncertainties associated with RE, EVs, and electricity price, a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL), namely twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to develop an optimized control strategy to minimize operating costs and satisfy charging expectations. The energy management problem is first formulated as a Markov decision process. Then, TD3 solely relies on the limited observation to find the optimal continuous control strategy. The proposed method flexibly adjusts the operating and charging strategies of components according to RE output and electricity price. Its real-time optimized performance on three consecutive days along with electricity price is evaluated, indicating its practical potential for future application. Additionally, comparison results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the total costs up to 15.27% and 4.24%, respectively, compared to traditional optimization and other DRL methods, which illustrates the superiority of the TD3 method on optimizing total costs of the considered MG.

Most vehicle systems use passive sensing; they must be positioned downwind of sources to detect emissions. A major deployment challenge is predicting the best measurement locations and driving routes to sample infrastructure. Here, we present and validate a methodology that incorporates high-resolution weather forecast and geospatial data to predict measurement locations and optimize driving routes. The methodology estimates the downwind road intersection point (DRIP) of theoretical CH4 plumes emitted from each well or facility. DRIPs serve as waypoints for Dijkstra&apos;s shortest path algorithm to determine the optimal driving route. We present a case study to demonstrate the methodology for planning and executing a vehicle-based concentration mapping survey of 50 oil and gas wells near Pecos, Texas. Validation was performed by comparing DRIPs with 174 CH4 plumes measured by vehicle surveys of oil and gas wells and facilities in Alberta, Canada. Results indicate median Manhattan distances of 145.8 m between DRIPs and plume midpoints and 160.3 m between DRIPs and peak plume enhancements. A total of 46 (26%) of the plume segments overlapped DRIPs. Locational errors of DRIPs are related to misattributions of emissions sources and discrepancies between modeled and instantaneous wind direction measured when the vehicle intersects plumes. Although the development of the methodology was motivated by CH4 emissions from oil and gas facilities, it should be applicable to other types of point source air emissions from known facilities. Implications: This paper presents and validates a method that addresses the challenge of measuring industrial emissions from public roads. The method can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of targeted vehicle-based emissions surveys where the locations of potential sources are known. We believe the method has broad application in addition to the upstream oil and gas context it was designed for.

Frequency stability of modern power systems has been considerably harmed by fast and unpredictable power variations generated by intermittent power generation sources and flexible loads. The main objective of the power system frequency control is to ensure the generation demand balance at all times. In reality, obtaining precise estimates of the imbalance of power in both transmission and distribution systems is challenging, especially when renewable energy penetration is high. Electric vehicles have become a viable tool to reduce the occasional impact of renewable energy sources engaged in frequency regulation mainly because of vehicle-to-grid technologies and the quick output power management of EV batteries. The rapid response of EVs enhances the effectiveness of the LFC system significantly. This research work investigates a deep learning strategy based on a long short-term memory recurrent neural network to identify active power fluctuations in real-time. The new approach assesses power fluctuations from a real-time observed frequency signal precisely and quickly. The observed power fluctuations can be used as a control reference, allowing automatic generation control to maintain better system frequency and ensure optimum generation cost with the use of demand management techniques. To validate the suggested method and compare it with several classical methods, a realistic model of the Indian power system integrated with distributed generation technology is used. The simulation results clearly indicate the importance of power fluctuation identification as well as the benefits of the proposed strategy. The results clearly show a considerable improvement in response performance indices, as the maximum peak overshoot was decreased by 21.25% to 51.2%, and settling time was lowered by about 23.34% to 65.40% for the suggested control technique compared to other controllers.

Increased adoption of electric vehicles (EV) is seen as a positive step toward minimizing air pollution as well as carbon emissions. Rapid proliferation of electric vehicles as well as charging stations has exacerbated voltage quality as well as harmonic distortion difficulties, which harm the efficiency of combined renewable energy. This research proposes novel hybrid design techniques in control systems that enhance the energy efficiency of electronic converters for power electronics. The control system enhancement has been carried out using a hybrid energy storage electric convertor, and energy efficiency is improved using a synergetic battery reference adaptive controller. A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)&apos;s internal combustion engine with a small photovoltaic (PV) module is utilised to assess a proposed control method which effectively regulates electric power on-grid by draining electricity from batteries during peak hours as well as then charging them during off-peak times, lowering the load on the converter as well as allowing electric vehicles to charge faster.

The main purpose of the proposed technique is &quot;to decrease the real and reactive power loss through the optimal allocation of the electric vehicles parking lot, and also decreases the cost.&quot; The proposed technique is used to evaluate the reliability of the smart grid based on the state matrix incorporation of random parameters of the electric vehicle. In addition, the proposed technique helps to increase the calculation speed by detecting the desired count of electric vehicle states required. The proposed technique is executed in MATLAB/Simulink platform. The efficiency of the proposed technique is compared with other existing techniques, like CHA, SSA and S2NA-GEO. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the cost and also locates the optimal global solution efficiently and accurately.

Energy resources such as solar, wind, energy storage systems, and microgas turbines supply energy to the microgrid. An EVCS works as a vehicle-to-grid (V-G), and it can send energy to the microgrid. The capacities of solar panels, storage systems, and wind turbines can be expanded by implementing capacity expansion planning in a microgrid. The short-term and long-term expansion problem has been solved by optimizing the hourly operation of the resources and with a five-year planning horizon, respectively. A hybrid algorithm combining the sample average approximation technique and the apriori progressive hedging algorithm (SAAT-APHA) has been proposed in this study. The impact of the availability of different resources, including wind, solar, and V-G power on the system performance has been analyzed. Finally, a comparison has been performed with three other algorithms, and the results show the superiority of the proposed method.

With the optimal performance of resources and storage generators based on a proper energy management system, it is expected that hubs can gain financial benefits from energy markets and ancillary services. So, the paper presents the participation of networked energy hubs in day-ahead (DA) reserve regulation and energy markets, where the hub operator incorporates a coordinated energy management (CEM) strategy to manage power sources and energy storage devices within the hub. Hence, this problem maximizes the total profit of hubs in the DA energy and up and down reserve markets. Also, the problem is constrained by optimal power flow (OPF) constraints in gas, electricity, and thermal networks, reserve limits, and hub constraints, including the model of the combined heat and power (CHP), renewable energy source (RES), electrical/thermal storage, parking lots of electric vehicles (EVs), and boiler. Following that, a linear format is obtained for the nonlinear equation using traditional linearization methods so that an optimal solution is found in less time considering less computational error. Eventually, a standard case system is used to test the strategy, and thus, the capabilities of the approach are investigated. The obtained findings validate the potential of the proposed design in enhancing the economic situation of power sources and storage in hub form, which can enhance operation indices by optimal management of the hub so that the energy management of resources and storage in the form of a hub based on CEM compared to their independent management plan has been able to increase the profit of these elements in energy and up and down reserve markets by about 17%, 28%, and 15%, respectively. Regarding technical indices of energy networks, the proposed scheme by creating low energy losses in the gas network and providing pressure drop, overvoltage, and overtemperature within their permissible limits succeeded in reducing the energy losses in electricity and heat networks by about 83% and 38%, respectively, compared to power flow studies. Also, in these conditions, it has reduced the maximum voltage and temperature drop by 45% and 39%, respectively.

As a result, the renewable energy sources (RES) have been playing an increasingly important role in the generation portfolio. Power system flexibility maintaining the power balance under uncertain and variable RES generation has become a major concern during the energy transition. This paper proposes to apply new energy vehicles (NEV) including electric vehicles (EVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) as dayahead flexibility resources to make revenue by providing comprehensive capacity/energy flexibility in the ancillary service market. First, the detailed joint optimized operational strategies of the NEV fleet and the EV charging/hydrogen refuelling stations are formulated. Second, the design and service clearing methodology of the ancillary service market for flexibility enhancement is introduced. A gametheoretic model is applied to determine the equilibrium price for both the demand and suppliers (namely NEV fleets) of operational flexibility. Third, case studies using IEEE benchmark systems are provided to validate the proposed methods. The results demonstrate that the joint optimization of NEV fleets, charging stations, and hydrogen refuelling stations can improve the power system operational flexibility, reduce the charging expense of NEV owners, and reduce the carbon emission by utilizing the green hydrogen.

A transition to battery electric vehicles (BEV) would accelerate the decarbonisation of road transport and provide other benefits. But in Australia, BEV uptake has been negligible, and the scale and pace required to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 has not been addressed to date. This study applies a national-scale integrated macroeconomic model (iSDG-Australia) to project Australia&apos;s future road transport demand, vehicle mix, energy consumption and GHG emissions by 2050. It models five scenarios incorporating different levels of economic and population growth, vehicle longevity, ambitions for BEV uptake, fleet renewal, forced phase-out of fossil-fuelled vehicles and shifts to renewable electricity. Scenario projections are benchmarked on their zero-emission vehicle mix, fuel and electricity consumption, GHG emissions, and broader social and economic impacts. We conclude the scale and pace of change must be transformational rather than transitional, requiring urgent policy action. An ambitious and rapid transition to 100% BEVs in new vehicle sales, accelerated fleet renewal, and a shift to renewable electricity generation could achieve a net-zero outcome for Australia&apos;s road transport sector by 2050.

This apparently &apos;green&apos; solution may come at a grave environmental cost however, especially in those parts of the world already vulnerable to climate change. This is because the metals required to make electric vehicle batteries  and to store renewable energy supplies, can be found in the deep seas.

The topology consists of a single DC source, two capacitors, a switched-capacitor (SC) and a floating capacitor (FC), and eleven power electronics switches. Due to the inherent voltage boosting capability, the proposed inverter is suitable for low-scale voltage applications such as photovoltaic (PV), fuel cell, and single battery-operated electric vehicles (EVs). A sensorless approach is introduced to stabilize the requisite voltage across the FC for any changes in input voltage. A generalized topology is also presented to obtain n-times voltage gain along with a high number of intermediate voltage levels. The PSV of the switches does not exceed the value of the input DC voltage, irrespective of increase in voltage gain. The results show that the voltage across the FC is unaffected by stepped variations in the modulation indices, power factor of load, pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques, and the operating frequency. Furthermore, when the input voltage changes, the voltage across the FC is automatically adjusted to a new requisite value within 0.6 s. The topology works for a wide range of modulation indices (01) and loads. A thorough analysis is done to show that the proposed topology is superior to recent topologies.

With the promotion given to RE and EVs in India, the Demand Response (DR) can become a key part of the puzzle that can help the Indian power sector for its smooth working. The importance of DR is because of its potential to alleviate network congestion, improve reliability, and be cost-effective while maintaining demand-supply balance.

However, current research on brake emissions, particularly the intensity and characteristics of emissions under real road conditions, is significantly inadequate compared to exhaust emissions. To this end, a dataset of 600 (200 unique real-world braking events simulated using three types of brake pads) real-world braking events (called brake pad segments) was constructed and a mapping function between the average brake emission intensity of PM 2.5 from the segments and the segment features was established by five algorithms (multiple linear regression (MLR) and four machine learning algorithms). Based on the five algorithms, the importance of the different features of the fragments was discussed and brake energy intensity (BEI) and metal content (MC) of the brake pad emissions were identified as the most significant factors affecting brake emissions and used as the final modeling features. Among the five algorithms, categorical boosting (CatBoost) had the best prediction performance, with a mean R2 and RMSE of 0.83 and 0.039 respectively for the tenfold cross-validation. In addition, the CatBoost-based model was further compared with the MOVES model to demonstrate its applicability. The CatBoost-based model has better prediction performance than the MOVES model. The MOVES model overpredicts brake fragment emissions for urban roads and underpredicts brake fragment emissions for motorways. Furthermore, the CatBoost-based model was interpreted and visualized by an individual conditional expectation (ICE) plot to break the machine learning &quot;black box&quot;, with BEI and MC showing nonlinear monotonic increasing relationships with braking emissions. ICE plot also provides viable technical solutions for controlling brake emissions in the future. Both avoiding aggressive braking driving behavior (e.g., the application of smart transportation technologies) and using brake pads with less metal content (e.g., using ceramic brake pads) can effectively reduce brake emissions. The construction of a machine learning-based brake emission model and the white-boxing of its model provide excellent insights for the future detailed assessment and control of brake emissions.

In recent years, to replace these automobiles with clean choices, electric vehicles are developed. So far, three kinds of electric vehicles including hybrid, plug-in, and full-electric vehicles are introduced. In the hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles, both the internal combustion engine and electric motor are used to move the vehicle. However, in the full-electric vehicle, the movement of the vehicle is done only by the electric motor. Due to the development of the electric vehicles in the transportation system, different aspects of these vehicles such as reliability must be studied. The reliability indices of the electric vehicles are affected by the failure rate of the composed components. Thus, to exactly determine the reliability performance of the electric vehicles, the failure rate of the main composed components affected by different parameters such as speed of the vehicle and temperature is taken into account. In the present paper, to accurately study the reliability of all-electric vehicles, the impact of variation in the temperature and vehicle speed on the failure rate of the composed components including battery, inverter, electric motor, and other static and rotation parts of the full-electric vehicle and consequently the failure rate of the vehicle is investigated. To determine the impact of operating temperature on the failure rate of composed components, the Arrhenius law is proposed. Based on the variation in the vehicle failure rate in terms of the vehicle speed and temperature, the reliability of the electric vehicle at different conditions is determined. It is concluded from numerical results performed in the paper that the failure rate of the understudied full-electric vehicle varies between 3.5 and 6 failures per year when the temperature varies between 0 and 50°C and the vehicle speed varies between 0 and 200 km/h.

A 2014 update to the standard included certain types of renewable electricity as qualifying fuels, supporting vehicle electrification within the RFS for the first time. This study investigates the potential under existing regulatory authority to expand deployment of low-carbon waste-to-electricity pathways, yielding revenue that could be used to subsidize electric vehicle (EV) sales or to support other RFS-aligned climate and transport-sector goals. We find that by accounting for drivetrain efficiency in credit allocation and creating a centralized entity to accrue credits, the RFS could generate $8.7 to $24 billion in revenues annually that could be used to provide EV subsidies of $3600 to $9200 or to otherwise accelerate transport electrification. The economic potential for qualifying waste-derived bioelectricity production could meet EV fleet demand to at least 2029. Absent a federal Low Carbon Fuel Standard, or other technology-neutral fuel policy, the RFS could effectively support widespread vehicle electrification. Expansion of waste-derived electricity could mitigate or increase pollutant exposure for some populations, so policy design and implementation must pay close attention to environmental health, justice, and equity.  The Renewable Fuel Standard could be adapted to support vehicle electrification.  Current waste-derived power could fuel US electric vehicles for up to three years.  US waste could enable an electric vehicle subsidy of $3600 - $9200 in 2030.  Subsidy size is dependent upon consideration of drivetrain efficiency in policy.  A central credit accruer can direct revenues to efficiently achieve policy goals.

Local air pollution is aggravated along with adoption of electric vehicles.  The economically efficient EV subsidy ranges from 305 to 1847 CNY.  Purchases of electric vehicles are more than ten times over-subsidized in China. Electric vehicles rapidly expand in China during the past decade. The expansion is often justified for the environmental benefits from fleet electrification. However, the magnitude of such benefits depends on many contextual factors and we need country-specific evaluations. We provide such an evaluation. The results are mixed. While adopting an electric vehicle helps mitigate CO 2 emission and induces climate benefits, the much-expected environmental benefit of EVs in terms of improving local air quality can only be achieved under an ultra-low emission grid. Further, we compare the short-run environmental impacts of fleet electrification, largely motivated by China&apos;s intensive EV subsidies, against the much enhanced 20132014 subsidy schemes that become quite ambitious during 20132014. It is revealed that the ambitious subsidies cannot be justified by the short-run environmental benefits, even when the global and local pollution mitigation benefits are both taken into consideration. Finally, jurisdictions that extensively import electricity may divert part of the environmental damage caused by driving of EVs to other regions, however, the local damage is still comparable, or even exceeds that associated with driving a gasoline vehicle. We contribute to the existing literature in two ways: 1) we examine the marginal changes in emissions and health consequences of fleet electrification in China; 2) we explicitly deal with both direct and indirect flows across provincial electricity grids in mainland China.

The inclusion of demand response (DR) program in the operational planning of microgrid can decrease the burden on the operator, but it requires aggregators for the efficient coordination between the operator and several potential DR participants of the microgrid. In this work, an optimization model is proposed to include a novel incentive-based DR program in the energy management problem of the reconfigured grid-connected microgrid. Two different aggregators for EV and non-EV loads are included in the work as an interface between the operator and DR participants. The objective of the proposed DR program is to maximize the incentives offered to the DR participants while maintaining uniformity in terms of rewards and distress delivered to the DR participants. The proposed work is analyzed on a static model of a 33-bus grid-connected microgrid consisting of EV charging stations, renewable energy sources, and diesel generators at different locations. The microgrid is reconfigured at each operating interval to minimize the power lost in the network. The result confirms that optimality is achieved at the source, distribution, and load side of the microgrid. For a day-ahead operation, it has been found that the energy dependency of a microgrid on the utility grid and conventional energy source is reduced by 9.62% and 29.06%, respectively.

Impact of electric vehicles on power dispatch is studied by considering its uncertainty charging characteristics. MonteCarlo simulation is employed for uncertainty modeling. For this work, three different charging strategies are followed up, namely, uncontrolled, controlled, and smart charging strategy to observe the impact of electric vehicles on micro-grid. So, here an endeavor has been made using a potent and robust technique i.e. improved whale optimization algorithm for obtaining optimal power dispatch. The suggested method&apos;s appropriateness and effectiveness are evaluated by modeling a grid-connected micro-grid. The outcomes of this technique improve the MG&apos;s performances in terms of best solution and economic operation. On different case studies, the outcomes are compared with other methods without and with charging strategy of electric vehicles. It is seen that operating cost obtained without electric vehicles is nearly 300$ and with charging strategy, i.e. uncontrolled, controlled, and smart of electric vehicles are 664$, 390$, and 327$, respectively. So, inclusion of vehicles on MG increases operating cost but its impact on micro-grid significantly reduces the operating cost for smart charging strategy in comparison with other charging strategy.

A shift in charging behavior could substantially reduce emissions if aligned with the fluctuating availability of renewable energy. Financial incentives and environmental appeals have been discussed as potential means to achieve this. We report evidence from a randomized controlled trial in which cost-free and &quot;green&quot; charging was advertised via email notifications to customers of a charging service provider. Emails invited to charge during midday hours (11:00 to 15:00) of days with high predicted shares of renewable energy. Results show a significant increase in the number of charging processes in the critical time, and in the amount of energy charged (kWh), despite only marginal monetary savings of 5 on average. A further increase in kWh charged was observed on weekends. Under the assumption that these charging processes replaced regular overnight charging at home, this represents reduction in CO 2 emissions of over 50%.

The overall performance of the electric vehicle is highly dependent on the electricity mix consumed during their production and use phase. Therefore, a comprehensive and dynamic assessment is necessary to provide accurate guidance to users and policymakers. Therefore, this study presents a comparative cradle to grave life cycle analysis of electric vehicles in 10 selected countries using the current and future electricity mix scenarios. We present the environmental footprint of vehicle production, transportation, and use phases. The results revealed that EVs in China with current (2019) and future 2025 electricity mix scenarios had a higher impact than all other EVs. In contrast, EV with 2030 Norway electricity mix was an optimal choice and has the least environmental impact in most of the selected categories. Moreover, it was also found that all EVs with 2030 electricity mix had lower environmental damages than EV 2019 electricity mix. Besides, this study outcome indicated that the use of clean energy could help to decrease the environmental impact and mitigate climate change all around the globe.  Life cycle assessment was performed for current and future electric vehicles.  EVs were produced in China, Germany and USA for comparison.

Hence, a novel type-2 fuzzy proportional derivative-integral control tactic is suggested for controlling load frequency in a deregulated power system with distributed generating (DG) units and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The suggested controller is tuned with arithmetic optimizer (AO) to minimize the integrated time-squared error. Practical constraints such as boiler characteristics, governor dead bands, and generation rate constraints are incorporated into the thermal system. Simulations show the superiority of the suggested scheme compared to integral, proportional-derivative, proportional-integral, proportional-integral-derivative, and type-1 fuzzy logic proportional-derivative branched with integral controllers in rejecting step load disturbances occurring in frequency deviations and tie-line power. Furthermore, the dominance of the suggested AO over other well-known evolutionary methods is established by performing comparative studies. The robustness of the suggested strategy is also studied by considering ±30% perturbation in various system parameters. Moreover, the efficiency of the suggested scheme in rejecting random load disturbance, and the effect of integrating DG units and PEVs on the system are also studied. Finally, the suggested control scheme&apos;s dominance is also demonstrated by comparing the results with previously reported control strategies. The maximum frequency deviation in area-1 is improved by 1.35% while that of area-2 is improved by over 6.70% as compared to reported works.

Additional electric load could pose a significant challenge to a grid with high levels of variable and non-dispatchable renewable energy sources. This scenario is not well-examined, nor is the use of pumped hydro energy storage for low-cost energy balancing. In this paper, we investigate the electrification of land transport within a photovoltaics and wind dominated 100% renewable electricity system. Only technologies that are deployed at scale and widely available globally are considered, namely photovoltaics, wind, battery electric vehicles, high voltage transmission, and pumped hydro. As a case study we present an hourly energy balance analysis of the Australian National Electricity Market with 100% renewables and 100% uptake of electric vehicles for land transport. The cost of the system is determined by occasional periods (days-weeks) of low renewable generation, and therefore only weakly dependent on the charging regime. The 40% increase in electricity demand due to electric land transport can be incorporated with a 4%8% increase in the levelized cost of electricity. An exception occurs if most passenger vehicle charging occurs during the evening peak period, in which case the average price increases by about 18%.

The presented CS also includes the features of power quality at nonlinear loads connected at the point of common coupling (PCC). This CS comprises a battery bank, multi-EV batteries, and ultra-capacitor (UC) charging spots. However, a dramatic increase of EVs and charging stations in the existing grid has raised the issues related to the harmonics, voltage fluctuations, reactive power, and burden on the grid. These issues are addressed in the presented charging station. Moreover, the ultra-capacitor can provide fast charging, which minimizes the high inrush current of the CS. Therefore, the batteries during the high EVs load at the CS are protected by the ultra-capacitor spots. To stabilize the DC bus voltage, separate cascaded controllers for ultra-capacitor and battery spots are used. The CS shows the multifunctional capabilities, which include PV array to grid (PV2G), PV array to the EV battery (S2EVB), EV battery to grid (EVB2G), and PV array to home (PV2H) when PV source is present. The various EVB2G, G2EVB, battery to home (EVB2H), and grid to home (G2H) behaviors are also presented. This CS shows good dynamic efficacy under insolation variation, EVB2G, G2EVB modes, load throw, and load reconnection operations. The grid current THD using the proposed current control is 1.44%, which is in accordance with the IEEE-519 standard. Moreover, the maximum power obtained from the PV generation is 63 kW, which is successfully distributed in the battery bank and six EV batteries (30 kW), in nonlinear load (14 kW), and the rest of the power is injected to the grid (29 kW).

With high penetration levels of the EVs, its addition to the existing distribution line infrastructure affects the power quality and grid stability. Additionally, EV charging loads are characteristically different as they are mobile compared to other fixed node-connected loads. Proposing solutions without considering these factors may result in grid congestion and subsequent over/under compensations. Another emerging dynamics co-occurring in the distribution system is high penetration levels of renewable energy in the utility grid. Although these dynamics pose challenges in stable grid operation, it also gives opportunities for solving some of the grid integration issues of EV loads. Thus, the effect of adding EV charging load to the existing low voltage distribution system must be analyzed by considering different criteria such as grid impact with different EV chargers, mobile nature of EV load, power quality, voltage profile, and spread/peak demand of load curve. This paper presents a detailed report on the impact analysis of EV integration on the component and system levels. For analyzing the effect on power quality (component level), grid pollution contributed by EV chargers along with possible solutions is elucidated. Detailed discussion on the significance of EV load location, existing load distribution, and nature of EV charging load distribution is presented by considering different feeders and different load curves. These discussions are supported with simulated case studies followed by a review of existing literature for enhanced understanding. Finally, techniques employed to effectively model the mobile nature of EV load and distributed EVs potential to provide ancillary solutions are also explained.

For the implementation of the energy system transformation, however, there are numerous options for the design of sector coupling, each of which is accompanied by different infrastructure requirements. This paper presents the extension of the REMix energy system modelling framework to include the gas sector and its application for investigating the cost-optimal design of sector coupling in Germany&apos;s energy system. Considering an integrated optimisation of all relevant technologies in their capacities and hourly use, a path to a climate-neutral system in 2050 is analysed. We show that the different options for flexible sector coupling are all needed and perform different functions. Even though flexible electrolytic production of hydrogen takes on a very dominant role in 2050, it does not displace other technologies. Hydrogen also plays a central role in the seasonal balancing of generation and demand. Thus, large-scale underground storage is part of the optimal system in addition to a hydrogen transport network. These results provide valuable guidance for the implementation of the energy system transformation in Germany.  Combination of all options for flexible sector coupling has high synergy potential.  Flexible hydrogen production is a key enabler of renewable energy system integration.  Hydrogen storage and transport networks are important future energy infrastructures.  Climate targets require a timely acceleration of sector coupling implementation.

The proposed hybrid system is the joint implementation of Spike Neural Network Learning Algorithm (S2NA) algorithm and Golden Eagle Optimizer (GEO) algorithm; hence, it is known as S2NAGEO strategy. An innovative uncertainty mode of renewable energy sources (RESs) based upon S2NAGEO strategy is proposed, which can avert the difficult parameter collection and formula derivation. Pricebased mode is accepted as EVs are considered responsive loads, which also take into account the spatialtemporal uncertainty of electric vehicles. Here, two fluctuation indexes are determined as quantitative evaluation of the volatility of RESs, then the charging cost is adopted as a guideline for the satisfaction of electric vehicle charging. The main purpose of the proposed system is diminishing the real and reactive power loss through the optimal allocation of the EVs as parking spot and minimizes the cost. In this article, the sensitivity of the voltage is conducted via four sensitivity indexes computation for regulating the candidate sites for charging and discharging. The charging infrastructure integrates the entire equipment and programming for the exchange of energy as electrical grid to the vehicle for this purpose; the sensitivity analysis is carried out assessing the inverse Jacobian matrix as power flow studies. To optimally decide the parking lot size, the biogeographybased optimization (BBO) system is assumed. The optimal size parking lot is estimated via the proposed WFSCGO technique. The proposed method is activated in MATLAB/Simulink site, and the performance is compared with existing methods.

Hydrogen and thermal storage systems can play a favorable role in facilitating the application of renewable energies at mine sites owing to their relatively less expensive storage costs. This study aims to offer a renewable energy system for full provision of electricity, haulage and thermal power at remote mines through hybridization of renewable and multi-storage systems. A comprehensive techno-economic evaluation has been conducted to identify the optimal renewable solutions for different types of mining methods. The results of this study indicate that while hydrogen-powered vehicles deem to be a cost-effective solution for surface mines, battery electric vehicles are ideally suited for application in underground mining. Also, it reveals that hybridizing fuel cell and battery for electric storage results in economically superior performance compared to fuel cell alone and battery alone options for both surface and underground mining methods.  A fully decarbonized energy system for a variety of mining operations is developed.  Hydrogen-powered fleet is identified as a promising solution in surface mines.  Battery electric vehicles are found to be more suitable for underground mines.  Hybridizing fuel cell and battery for electric storage yields better economic results.

However, if EVCS are exclusively supplied by the grid, negative impacts on its stability together with possible CO 2 emission increases could be produced. Introduction of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) for EVCS can cope with both drawbacks by reducing the load on the grid and generating clean electricity. This paper develops a weighted multicriteria methodology to design the most suitable configuration of HRES for EVCS. This method determines the local renewable resources and the EVCS electricity demand. Then, taking into account environmental, economic and technical aspects, it deduces the most adequate HRES power generation planning for EVCS. Besides, an experimental stage to validate the design deduced from the multicriteria methodology is included. Therefore, the final power generation planning for the HRES in EVCS is supported not only by a complete numerical evaluation, but also by an experimental verification of the demand being fully covered. Methodology application to Valencia (Spain) proves that an off-grid HRES with solar PV, wind and batteries support would be the most suitable configuration for the system. This solution was also experimentally verified.  The paper presents a novel multicriteria methodology to design HRES for EVCS.  An experimental stage of the power balance and SOC is included in the methodology.  Valencia (Spain) is chosen as a case study due to its environmental policies.  The best configuration is an off-grid HRES with solar PV, wind resources and batteries.

But it is a fact that the zero emission claims of electric vehicles are not valid for developing countries, where nonrenewable energy sources are the dominant form of electricity generation. The introduction of electric vehicles in countries that depend on conventional energy sources for electricity generation will only shift the threat of increasing emissions from the operations stage to the energy generation stage. This article compares an assessment of the energy mix of one developing country, India, which relies on fossil fuel for energy generation, and one developed country, France, which relies on nuclear fuel, which is a non-greenhouse gas emitting energy source. Equivalent carbon emissions from electric vehicles for both countries are calculated and compared with emissions from fossil fuel-based vehicles. The results of this study show that the introduction of electric vehicles will increase overall carbon emissions in countries relying on conventional fossil fuels for power generation. By conducting reverse calculations, the study suggests that energy mix requirements need to be met before introducing electric vehicles to ensure a 50-percent reduction of overall emissions. Post-treatment emission control strategies for existing fossil fuel-based vehicles are discussed and a modeling study is performed for the development of a novel microwave-based regeneration system.

This study investigates the impacts of DR on NO 2 concentration at the traffic analysis zone (TAZ) level, which is particularly defined for traffic-related spatial data analysis. Measured NO 2 data, citywide scale cellular data, and traffic-related data were collected for analysis. Inverse distance weighting (IDW) model was used to obtain NO 2 at each TAZ. The traffic model of Nanjing was built in TranStar, a mesoscopic traffic simulation platform. Based on TAZ level NO 2 , traffic demand, and traffic status data, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was developed. DR with different proportions and spatial scales were simulated in TranStar and evaluated based on the predictions of the GWR model. Results suggest that morning rush hour is the only time in the day when urban traffic is the main cause of NO 2 &apos;s rise. Larger traffic volume and severer congestion with lower speed lead to the higher rise of NO 2. The main factors influencing the rise of NO 2 could be different at distinct locations. DR strategies can decrease the rise of NO 2 significantly for most TAZs. Restriction proportion has significantly higher impacts than spatial scale, and the effects of scale enlarge with the rise of proportion. A side effect of DR is that the rise of NO 2 would be higher in certain regions due to travelers&apos; mode shift and detour, which is a key point for policymakers to weigh the pros and cons.

This study has been performed for the city of Turin, where road transport represents one of the main primary emission sources. Air pollution data were evaluated by ADMS-Roads, the flow traffic data used for simulation come from a real-time monitoring. Instead, statistics on mortality and hospitalizations due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were collected from the regional health information system and the National Health Institute and implemented in the BenMap software to evaluate the health and economic impacts. In both cases, two scenarios to evaluate the annual benefits of reducing PM 10 , PM 2.5 and NO 2 were used: reduction to the levels gained by the assumptions of 2025 and 2030 Scenario and the PM 10 , PM 2.5 and NO 2 concentrations were considered for evaluating short-term and long-term effects. The analysis performed doesn&apos;t include background pollution levels, i.e. the concentrations percentage reductions are only related to the local contribution, therefore derived from the contribution only of traffic source. The results show that fleet electrification has a potential benefit for concentrations reduction in comparison to the base Scenario, especially related to NO 2 , less for PM 10 and PM 2.5. Regarding 2025 Scenario (4 % (passenger car) and 5 % (light-duty vehicles) electric vehicles), reductions of 52 % of NO2, 35 % of PM10 and 49 % of PM2.5 are observed. Meanwhile, as regards 2030 Scenario reductions of 87 % of NO2, 36 % of PM10 and 50 % of PM2.5 are reached. Also, in terms of social costs a decrease of 47 % for the 2025 Scenario and 66 % for the 2030 Scenario in comparison to the base Scenario is arise.  A 5 % share of electric vehicles reduces NO 2 concentrations by 52 %.  Particulate matter is less impacted by the number of circulating electric vehicles.  Social benefits due to lower pollutant concentrations are significant (reduction of 47 % and 66 % in terms of social costs).  ADMS-Roads enhanced by real-time traffic data is a valid predictive tool.

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are the representative ones because they can satisfy the power demand by coordinating energy supplements among different energy storage devices. To achieve this goal, energy management approaches are crucial technology, and driving cycles are the critical influence factor. Therefore, this paper aims to summarize driving cycle-driven energy management strategies (EMSs) for HEVs. First, the definition and significance of driving cycles in the energy management field are clarified, and the recent literature in this research domain is reviewed and revisited. In addition, according to the known information of driving cycles, the EMSs are divided into three categories, and the relevant study directions, such as standard driving cycles, long-term driving cycle generation, and short-term driving cycle prediction are illuminated and analyzed. Furthermore, the existing database of driving cycles in highway and urban aspects is displayed and discussed. Finally, this article also elaborates on the future prospects of energy management technologies related to driving cycles. This paper focusing on helping the relevant researchers realize the state-of-the-art of HEVs&apos; energy management field and also recognize its future development direction.  Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) as potential on-road vehicles are essentially discussed.  A thorough review of the energy management policy for HEV is conducted.

In-use emissions of vehicles are higher than the emission control certification levels. The current study uses a roadside remote sensing emission monitoring campaign to investigate (a) fraction of high emitters in the light-duty vehicle (LDV) fleet and their contributions to the total emissions, (b) emission inspection (I/M) programs&apos; effectiveness, and (c) alternate fuel (natural gas) encouragement policy. LDVs consist of passenger or freight transport vehicles with four wheels equivalent to classes M1 and N1 of European union vehicle classifications. The motivation is to assess the current emission inspection program&apos;s success rate and study the impact of the increased natural gas vehicle market share policy. It is also meant to present and validate remote sensing as a possible backup method to the current I/M program. The emission remote sensing campaign was conducted to measure emissions of CO, HC, and NO of the LDV fleet. Fleet age, engine size, and fuel type (gasoline or natural gas) were extracted and correlated with emissions. It was found that CO and HC emissions are five times higher for cars more than fifteen years old of age compared to those less than five years old. Analyses of high-emitters showed that almost 20% of the fleet were high-emitters and responsible for roughly half of CO, HC, and NO emissions. The correlation between the I/M program and the remote sensing to identify high-emitters was weak. Which indicates the need for an improved I/M program. It shows that even a limited remote sensing campaign is beneficial as a complementary monitoring tool to the I/M program. The study showed the same fraction of high-emitters in natural gas (methane) vehicles, despite the national policies to increase natural gas vehicle fraction in the market for reduced emissions. [Display omitted]  Higher high-emitter share was observed in domestically produced vehicles.  Share of carburetor type cars in emission was five times more than their fleet share.  No significant emission difference between gasoline- and natural gas-fueled vehicles.  A need for NOx emission testing was observed for annual emission inspection program.

To promote the waste to energy for the rural and urban communities, the biogas energy source is integrated along with the combined solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy sources. As a long life and scalable battery storage solution, VRFB storage is adopted for peak shaving and microgrid performance reliability. Power generation from the renewable sources, VRFB chargedischarge, and grid power usage are scheduled considering two practical electricity tariff profiles, thus making the overall microgrid system operation costeffective and efficient. The optimized cost of energy management is determined considering the operation and maintenance cost of energy source and battery storage, grid tariff profile, and power import and export. The performance of the overall control scheme is experimentally validated by a gridconnected hybrid microgrid consisting of 10 kWp solar PV, 1 kW wind turbine, 15 kVA biogas engine generator, and 1 kW 6 h VRFB storage.

Balancing services are needed, which can be provided by virtual power plants (VPP) that aggregate distributed energy resources (DER) to consume or produce electricity on demand. Electric vehicle (EV) fleets can use idle cars&apos; batteries as combined storage to offer balancing services on smart electricity markets. However, there are risks associated with this business model extension. The fleet faces severe imbalance penalties if it cannot charge the offered amount of balancing energy due to the vehicles&apos; unpredicted mobility demand. Ensuring the fleet can fulfill all market commitments risks denying profitable customer rentals. We study the design of a decision support system that estimates these risks, dynamically adjusts the composition of a VPP portfolio, and profitably places bids on multiple electricity markets simultaneously. Here we show that a reinforcement learning agent can optimize the VPP portfolio by learning from favorable market conditions and fleet demand uncertainties. In comparison to previous research, in which the bidding risks were unknown and fleets could only offer conservative amounts of balancing power to a single market, our proposed approach increases the amount of offered balancing power by 48% to 82% and achieves a charging cost reduction of the fleet by 25%. In experiments with realworld carsharing data of 500 EVs, we found that mobility demand forecasting algorithms&apos; accuracy is crucial for a successful bidding strategy. Moreover, we show that recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning decrease the convergence time and improve the results&apos; robustness. Our results demonstrate how modern RL algorithms can be successfully used for fleet management, VPP optimization, and demand response in the smart grid. We anticipate that DER, such as EVs, will play an essential role in providing reliable backup power for the grid and formulate market design recommendations to allow easier access to these resources.

Catenary diesel-hybrid trucks reduce air pollution only partly in urban areas.  Catenary trucks have a high uncertainty in case of costs and technical feasibility.  Fuel cell- and battery-electric trucks reduce CO 2 emissions up to 28%.  Fuel cell- and battery-electric trucks reduce NO x and PM emissions up to 19% and 7%. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is one of the greatest global challenges through 2050. Besides greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, such as nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions, has gained increasing attention in agglomerated areas with transport vehicles being one of the main sources thereof. Alternative fuels that fulfill the greenhouse gas reduction goals also offer the possibility of solving the challenge of rising urban pollution. This work focuses on the electric drive option for heavy and light duty vehicle freight transport. In this study, fuel cell-electric vehicles, battery-electric vehicles and overhead catenary line trucks were investigated, taking a closer look at their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and also considering the investment and operating costs of the required infrastructure. This work was conducted using a bottom-up transport model for the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. Two scenarios for reducing these emissions were analyzed at a spatial level. In the first of these, selected federal highways with the highest traffic volume were equipped with overhead catenary lines for the operation of diesel-hybrid overhead trucks on them. For the second spatial scenario, the representative urban area of the city of Cologne was investigated in terms of air pollution, shifting articulated trucks to diesel-hybrid overhead trucks and rigid trucks, trailer trucks and light duty vehicles to battery-electric or fuel cell-electric drives. For the economic analysis, the building up of a hydrogen infrastructure in the cases of articulated trucks and all heavy duty vehicles were also taken into account. The results showed that diesel-hybrid overhead trucks are only a cost-efficient solution for highways with high traffic volume, whereas battery overhead trucks have a high uncertainty in terms of costs and technical feasibility. In general, the broad range of costs for battery overhead trucks makes them competitive with fuel cell-electric trucks. Articulated trucks have the highest potential to be operated as overhead trucks. However, the results indicated that air pollution is only partially reduced by switching conventional articulated trucks to electric drive models. The overall results show that a comprehensive approach such as fuel cell-electric drives for all trucks would most likely be more beneficial.

The selfhealing method (SHM) is related to multiagent systembased restoration process (MASbased RP) that finds the optimal restoration pattern at the fault condition according to the different zone agents (ZAs) distributing along with the network. This method minimizes the difference between energy cost and flexibility benefit related to the FEM part and difference between the number of switching operation and priority loads restored based on the SHM part. Also, this problem subjects to power flow equations, RESs and active loads constraints, restoration process formulation and system operation limits. Stochastic programming is used to model the uncertainty of loads, energy prices, RESs and EVs. Hereupon, the suggested strategy is implemented on the 33bus radial distribution network and it is solved by the crow search algorithm (CSA). Ultimately, the obtained results imply the high flexibility and security of the operation, incorporating the proposed strategy, and delineate the optimal restoration scheme for the ADN.

Another drawback of fossil fuels is several threats like environmental pollution and global warming, which are potential risks for future generations. Given that the transportation sector makes a huge contribution to carbon emissions, the importance of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which are an eco-friendly form of vehicles is obvious. Because the BEV market has been rapidly expanding recently, it has become a significant issue to assess BEV alternatives comprehensively from the customer&apos;s point of view. This assessment can be made by addressing the basic features of each BEV. Further, multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques are efficient instruments for the right BEV purchase decision. In this work, therefore, ten BEVs are chosen as alternatives. These vehicles are then ranked using SECA, MARCOS, MAIRCA, COCOSO, ARAS, and COPRAS multi-criteria techniques on the basis of technical specifications, such as acceleration, price, battery, range, and so on. Afterward, results from various MCDM techniques are aggregated by applying the Borda count and Copeland ranking methodologies. &quot;Price&quot;, &quot;permitted load,&quot; and &quot;energy consumption&quot; are determined as the most three significant factors for BEV selection, respectively, whereas Tesla Model S is highlighted as the best choice. Further, the robustness and reliability of the results are performed by applying a sensitivity analysis. The proposed framework can be utilized as a basis for more detailed purchasing decisions.  A novel integrated MCDM model for BEV selection is presented.  Six MCDM methods as well as two ranking strategies are utilized.  10 BEVs are evaluated as per 11 factors.  Price, permitted load, and energy consumption are the most significant factors.  Tesla Model S is highlighted as the best choice.

The transition process starts with Ecuador&apos;s change in the productive matrix with reforms from the legal and business strategies point of view to the year 2050. Advances in energy material are dependent on political uncertainty both at the country (Ecuador) and local (Cuenca) levels. It is possible to stop using fossil fuels due to the implementation of new renewable energy sources, potentially rich in the Ecuadorian Southwest and evidenced in the National Plan for a Lifetime. Currently, there is evidence of accelerated changes concerning legal regulations, including the construction of several electric power generation plants. This change in the national productive matrix implies, among others, the implementation of electric vehicles and the change of natural gas stoves for electric ones, and the implementation of the &quot;4 Rios&quot; tram that crosses the city from North-South and South-North, incorporating 100% renewable energy generation, which would provide heat in urban and marginal urban areas. All the systems created in Ecuador, such as heating, cooling, transportation, security etc., will allow an increasing penetration of renewable energy until it reaches 100%. [Display omitted]  The scenario is 100% renewable energy by 2050 in the City of Cuenca in Ecuador.  The surrounding of the city of Cuenca have great renewable energy potential.

Socioeconomic and natural drivers of haze pollution are analyzed by spatial model.  The distribution of PM 2.5 concentration is closely related to wind direction.  Spillover effects of socioeconomic factors are greater than their local effects. Haze pollution is a serious interregional problem for many countries and wind direction plays a crucial role in the process of pollution transport. Upwind cities have obviously greater impacts on downwind cities due to atmospheric transport. Hence the directions of pollution spillover effects should be emphasized in empirical study to avoid model bias. With the panel data of 44 cities in North China Plain from 2013 to 2017, we constructed a novel wind direction weight matrix to analyze the spatial variations of PM 2.5 concentration. The matrix was then incorporated into a spatial panel model to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of socioeconomic and natural factors on PM 2.5 concentration. The results show that wind direction dominates the distribution of PM 2.5 concentration. The growth of per capita GDP facilitates the reduction of PM 2.5 pollution while the increase of the other socioeconomic factors aggravates haze pollution. Besides, natural factors directly or indirectly affect PM 2.5 concentration. Particularly, the spillover effects of socioeconomic factors are greater than their local effects. Based on the results, we suggested that investment of air pollution control in a neighboring area may be more effective than in the local city itself. The mechanism of pollutant transport should be fully considered in the fields such as the construction of urban air ducts, industrial layout, and eco-compensation.

This research investigates the potential of solar PV, energy storage, and electric vehicles in new housing developments and their associated grid impacts by taking the UK&apos;s Cambridge, Milton Keynes, Oxford arc as a case study. Using published data on electrical loads for different types of dwellings, energy demands for new housing developments with and without renewable and low carbon technologies are analysed using techno-economic modelling frameworks. Technical analysis includes sizing and optimisation of PV and storage while economic analysis covers cost-benefit analyses, by considering a range of existing and future tariffs and subsidy schemes including Standard, Economy 7 (cheaper electricity for 7 h at night), Feed-in tariff, and the Smart Export Guarantee. Results show that installing PV panels and storage systems not only reduces the dwellings&apos; grid energy demand by 31% in January but also helps the dwellings to become net exporters of green electricity to the grid in July and hence saves a substantial amount of money by taking advantage of Feed-in and Economy 7 tariffs.  Impact of new housing developments with PV, storage and EVs on the grid was studied.  The Cambridge, Milton Keynes, Oxford growth corridor was used as a case study.  Dwellings with PV and storage reduce 31% of grid electricity demand in January.  Dwellings with PV and storage become net exporters of electricity to the grid in July.

Both stand-alone and grid-connected cases are studied and discussed. The generated electrical power from renewable energy sources depends mainly on solar radiations, temperature, and wind speed. The incomes depend on the electrical power produced from renewable energy sources and the initial cost of investment as well as the operation and maintenance cost of renewable energy equipment. The analysis of different cases is performed using HOMER Software. The comparison of different configurations shows that the hybrid grid-connected system is the optimum solution to produce 1046807 kWh of electrical power from renewable energy sources with a minimum net project cost of 186 751 . The utilization of electrical power from the power grid is the most expensive solution with a net project cost of 5.07 million . The hybrid photovoltaic wind grid-connected system allows reducing of the cost of energy to 0.0117  per kWh with an optimum initial investment cost of 386 648 . The detailed analysis of proposed renewable energy solutions based on accurate informations gives every confidence in its reliability for future energy requirements of Oman. The proposed solutions hold good for this region in Oman in the long term. Indeed, installing renewable energy systems allows reducing electricity bills and participating in the national development plan related to green energy policy.

This technology can potentially boost the diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) and consequently contribute in reducing the local air pollution and the related externalities. In this context, an environmental and economic analysis has been performed to estimate the social costs saving derived by the decarbonization of the passenger cars mobility. The benefits evaluated in the analysis are compared to the investment and maintenance costs necessary to install and operate a DWPT infrastructure. This under the basic assumption of the present work that considers the widespread adoption of electric vehicles achievable only in presence of the parallel integration of DWPT systems in the motorway infrastructure. At the same time, the work takes into account the possible variations of the energy mix and the effects related to the increase of the electric energy demand related to the increase of the circulating electric vehicles. The analysis is carried out for the six most populous European countries (i.e. Italy, France, Germany, Poland, Spain and UK) and it indicates as the estimated social costs savings are capable to sustain the investment for a wide integration of DWPT in almost all these countries.  Transition from conventional to electric mobility reduces vehicle pollutants emission.  Sustainability of DWPT diffusion is studied considering external cost saving as leverage.  The analysis is carried out for the six most populous European countries.  Sustainability is reached also thanks to reduced electricity production from fossil fuel.

Forty-five vehicles equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with either the check-engine-light-on or malfunction-indicator-light (MIL)-on, or both, and in certain repairs categories, were identified and their emissions were measured before and after the repairs in this study. The post-repair nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions decreased by 46%75% for check-engine-light-on vehicles and by 53%81% for MIL-on vehicles at different test speeds. NOx reductions for more than 55% of the vehicles showed reductions greater than 80% for at least one test speed. Pre-repair opacity readings from these HDVs were mostly lower than 5%, except for 6 vehicles that showed the opacity readings from 5.3% to 12.3%. After the repairs, opacity readings for all vehicles were below 5%, and average reductions of 43% in opacity were found for both check-engine-light-on and MIL-on cases.

Operating conditions constrain the NO x reduction performance of aftertreatment devices. This study analysed real-world NO x emissions, tailpipe exhaust gas temperatures, and air-fuel ratios during cold start in a closed-loop urban route, followed by hot-start real driving emissions (RDE) tests. Five Euro-6b sport utility vehicles (SUV) were tested: two gasoline vehicles with three-way catalyst (TWC), namely, one gasoline direct injection (G-DI) and one hybrid electric vehicle (HEV); three diesel vehicles with different NO x control systems, namely, only exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), lean-burn NO x trap (LNT), and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The only-EGR- and LNT-equipped diesel vehicles and the G-DI vehicle surpassed the NO x Euro 6 limits in all tested sections. For the same vehicles, the total RDE emission factors were 9.0, 7.4, and 5.0 times the Euro 6 limits, respectively. In contrast, the diesel vehicle with SCR had an RDE emission factor 1.0 times the limit, and the HEV exhibited very low emissions at approximately 2 mg NO x km1. However, during the cold start phase (first 5 min), the emission levels of the SCR and HEV vehicles surpassed the Euro 6 limits by 2.7 and 1.1 times, respectively. Based on the measurements at the tailpipe, the results indicate that cold start, urban driving, and cooling conditions of aftertreatment devices can lead to a decrease in the NO x conversion efficiency of TWC and SCR systems. The air-fuel ratio was key for the NO x conversion in TWC aftertreatment. The large differences between G-DI and HEV vehicles were primarily attributed to the lean and rich operations of the G-DI and HEV engines, respectively. To comply with stringent future regulations, lean-burn engines would require diesel-like aftertreatment. SCR and hybrid vehicles would require a careful aftertreatment thermal management or heating to further exploit their potential for reducing emissions in urban areas.  Cold start strongly affected NO x reduction of SCR and TWC aftertreatments.  Post-Euro-6b diesel vehicles will require SCR devices and optimal thermal management.  Air-fuel ratio control is key for the performance of TWCs in gasoline vehicles.  Lean-burn-DI gasoline vehicles require diesel-like aftertreatments for NO x mitigation.  The HEV had very low NO x emissions using an enriched air-fuel ratio strategy.

The promising solution for reducing air pollution in cities is commonly regarded as electric vehicles, which helps to optimize the environment management more effectively, as a key to future low carbon mobility. However, their environmental benefits rely on the temporal and spatial sense of real use, and challenges such as limited range complicated for the rollout of an Electric Vehicle (EVs). This paper investigates the environmental carbon pollution in cities and control preventions using Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). Further, the Artificial intelligence model has been introduced, which defines optimal automobile designs and the assignment of vehicles to drivers across a variety of scenarios, including minimum net life cycle expense, GHG emissions, and oil usage for effective environmental management. By designing overspent vehicle power for corresponding output, weight, and cost impact, the life cycle costs and the emission of GHG are reduced utilizing high battery swinging and replacing batteries as needed. Moreover, energy consumption (EC) and pollution have been greatly influenced by the use of energy sources in the environment. The significant energy consumption and pollution variables resulted in a large proportion of coal-fired energy. The results show that the PHEV can achieve better fuel economy by combining the proposed model with an allowable deviation from the state of the charge.  PHEV promotes V2G infrastructure and provides low carbon emission.  This model investigates and defines optimal automobile designs in EV.  Our results with PHEV show better fuel economy with minimal deviations.

They should require them to clean up their contaminated soils, install modern tanks and piping, and abide by strict limits on carcinogenic benzene emissions.

Frequency fluctuations are introduced with the emergence of inverter-dominated renewable energy sources (RESs) as it does not provide rotational inertia to the grid, such as synchronous generators. In this study, the virtual synchronous generator (VSG) controlled inverter compensates for the lack of inertia. Particularly, this research work analyses the involvement of DC and EV batteries as ESSs in designing an integrated technical virtual power plant (VPP) to support frequency variations using the VSG concept. Microgrid (MG) simulations are performed in MATLAB/ Simulink platform. Case studies are carried out to validate the grid export and grid import performance of the model by using variations in the load and the solar irradiance of the MG. It is verified that bidirectional power flow takes place between the proposed VPP components and the grid that enables the grid with high penetration of RESs.

One of the most auspicious RES is wind turbine systems (WTSs), which can improve the performance of distribution systems. In turn, the integration of high WTS penetrations can also deviate the system operation away from the standard condition. To tackle this issue, we propose a method for enhancing the hosting capacity of multiple WTSs considering their intermittent generations in distribution systems. The proposed method considers the operation of the on-load tap changer (OLTC), allowing to solve voltage problems efficiently. Especially, the proposed method optimises the charging/discharging power of electric vehicles (EVs), which can contribute positively to regulating WTS intermittent generation. Additionally, the reactive power support of WTSs, complying with the IEEE 1547:2018 standard, is incorporated in the planning model of WTSs. To solve such an optimisation problem, a bi-level optimisation algorithm is developed based on the gravitational search algorithm. Comprehensive simulation results are performed on the 69-bus distribution feeder interconnected to four EV stations. Based on the results, the proposed approach can efficiently enhance/increase the hosting capacity of WTSs in distribution systems, thanks to the consideration of OLTC, reactive power support of WTSs and EVs.

Of special interest are battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which can enable significant emission reductions if electricity used is produced from renewable energy sources. However, mainly due to their high investment costs (retail purchase price) of BEVs, they are currently not economically competitive with conventional fossilfueled vehicles without different supporting policy measures. This paper analyzes current costs and future prospects for BEVs compared to conventional petrol cars looking at the total costs of ownership. Furthermore, the future prospects are investigated considering technological learning for BEVs, CO2 taxes for fuels, and various other policy framework conditions such as rebates for the purchase of the BEVs. The major conclusions are as follows: (i) to improve the economics of BEVs, a very important aspect is the introduction of CO2based fuel taxes; (ii) regarding economics, the second important aspect is the reduction of the investment costs of the BEVs due to technological learning, especially of the battery; (iii) in addition, the introduction of CO2based registration taxes for the purchase of passenger cars makes sense; (iv) subsidies or rebates for the purchase of a BEV maybe a measure successful in the short term and helpful to stimulate technological learning; (v) by far, the highest uncertainty regarding the future prospects of BEVs is how fast technological learning will take place, especially for the battery, and how the future development of batteries will be. © 2020 The Authors.

Benefits of vehicle electrification vary widely among metropolitan areas in the U.S.  Rapid fleet electrification warrants incentives due to quickly achievable benefits. The environmental consequences of electric vehicles (EV) have been extensively studied, but the literature on their health impacts is scant. At the same time, fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), for which transportation is a major source, remains an important public health issue in the United States. Motivated by recent developments in epidemiology and reduced-form air pollution modeling, as well as reductions in power plant emissions, we conduct an updated assessment of health benefits of light-duty vehicle electrification in large metropolitan areas (MSAs) in the United States. We first calculate MSA-specific mortality impacts per mile attributable to fine particles from internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) tailpipe emissions of PM 2.5 , SO 2 , NO x , NH 3 , and volatile organic compounds, and power plant emissions of PM 2.5 , SO 2 , and NO x. We complement these with changes in greenhouse-gas emissions associated with vehicle electrification. We find that electrification leads to large benefits, even with EVs powered exclusively by fossil fuel plants. VMT-weighted mean benefits in the 53 MSAs are 6.9 ¢/mile ($10,400 per 150,000 miles), 83% of which (5.7 ¢/mile or $8600 per 150,000 miles) comes from reductions in PM 2.5 -attributable mortality. Variability among the MSAs is large, with benefits ranging from 3.4 ¢/mile ($5100 per 150,000 miles) in Rochester, NY, to 11.5 ¢/mile ($17,200 per 150,000 miles) in New York, NY. This large variability suggests incentives should vary by MSA and presents an opportunity to target areas for EV deployment aimed at maximizing public health benefits. Impacts are smaller when EVs disproportionately replace newer ICEV models but EVs still lead to positive benefits in all MSAs. Vehicle electrification in urban areas is an opportunity to achieve large public health benefits in the United States in the short term.

Thus, the operating schedule of home appliances, renewable energy sources, and electric vehicles is optimized using a home energy management system in this paper. A pricebased demand response program is utilized for operational scheduling. Renewable energy resources and electric vehicle uncertainties as well as the hourly variation of solar irradiance and wind power are also taken into account. To achieve the best plan of devices operation, a technicaleconomic formulation is developed for HEM problem, and the multiobjective dragonfly algorithm is used for its optimization. The decisionaid approach is adopted for choosing the best compromise solution, that is, selecting the best operational schedule of home appliances from the Pareto front. Numerical simulations illustrated the proper performance of the proposed method in finding the best schedule of home devices and improving the operation indices of the smart home.

The model combines a high-resolution chemical transport model with an emission inventory established with detailed transportation and power plant information, as well as a framework to characterize and monetize the health impacts. Our study is set in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) in Canada with bounding scenarios for 25% and 100% EV penetration rates. Our results indicate that even with the worst-case assumptions for EV electricity supply (100% natural gas), vehicle electrification can deliver substantial health benefits in the GTHA, equivalent to reductions of about 50 and 260 premature deaths per year for 25% and 100% EV penetration, compared to the base case scenario. If EVs are charged with renewable energy sources only, then electrifying all passenger vehicles can prevent 330 premature deaths per year, which is equivalent to $3.8 Billion (2016$CAD) in social benefits. When the benefit of EV deployment is normalized per vehicle, it is higher than most incentives provided by the government, indicating that EV incentives can generate high social benefits. Image 1  This study quantified the changes in GHGemissions and air quality impacts of electric vehicles (EV) in Toronto.  The worst-case EV scenario (for electricity supply) can reduce 1500 to 6800Years of Life Lost per year.  The best-case scenario can reduce 330 premature deaths per year, equivalent to $3.8 Billion (2016$CAD).  The economic benefits of EVs under worst-case conditions are higher than current incentives for EV purchase. Main conclusion: Our results indicate that even with the worst-case assumptions for EV electricity supply (100% natural gas), vehicle electrification can deliver substantial health benefits in Toronto region.

The hybrid power system considered in this work includes thermal generating units, RERs such as wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) units, battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and electric vehicles (EVs). Here, the two objective functions are formulated, i.e., minimization of operating cost and system risk, to develop an optimum scheduling strategy of hybrid power system. The objective of proposed approach is to minimize operating cost and system risk levels simultaneously. The operating cost minimization objective consists of costs due to thermal generators, wind farms, solar PV units, EVs, BESSs, and adjustment cost due to uncertainties in RERs and EVs. In this work, Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is considered as the risk index, and it is used to quantify the risk due to intermittent nature of RERs and EVs. The main contribution of this paper lies in its ability to determine the optimal generation schedules by optimizing operating cost and risk. These two objectives are solved by using a multiobjective-based nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) algorithm, and it is used to develop a Pareto optimal front. A best-compromised solution is obtained by using fuzzy min-max approach. The proposed approach has been implemented on modified IEEE 30 bus and practical Indian 75 bus test systems. The obtained results show the best-compromised solution between operating cost and system risk level, and the suitability of CVaR for the management of risk associated with the uncertainties due to RERs and EVs.

However, the characteristics of VOCs emissions have not been fully elucidated. Ten representative vehicles were selected in Wuhan, China, and the VOCs emitted by these vehicles under actual working conditions were collected and analyzed through on-road tests. Results showed that the average concentrations of total VOCs emitted by gasoline and diesel vehicles were 5.9 ± 2.4 mg/m3 and 6.8 ± 3.0 mg/m3, while the average emission factors were 5.3 ± 2.2 mg/km and 33.9 ± 22.7 mg/km, respectively. The five compounds emitted at the highest levels by gasoline and diesel vehicles were hexanal, acetone, toluene, p-xylene and iso-pentane. Emission concentration of diesel vehicles was slightly higher than that of gasoline vehicles. Emission factor of diesel vehicles was much higher, because they consumed more fuel and produced more power than gasoline vehicles. The average concentrations of total VOCs emitted by China III, IV and V vehicles were 8.4 ± 1.4 mg/m3, 5.8 ± 3.4 mg/m3 and 5.3 ± 1.9 mg/m3, and their average emission factors were 21.7 ± 18.6 mg/km, 19.4 ± 28.9 mg/km and 9.1 ± 7.2 mg/km, respectively. Vehicle emissions decreased obviously as the emission standards increased. The average concentrations of total VOCs emitted under low-speed and high-speed conditions were 9.4 ± 3.5 mg/m3 and 5.5 ± 1.8 mg/m3. Concentrations of acetone, hexanal, toluene and p-xylene were the highest four VOCs under both conditions. The average emission factor of VOCs under high-speed conditions (24.0 ± 13.6 mg/km) was substantially lower than under low-speed conditions (54.0 ± 41.5 mg/km). Thus, tightening emission standards and reducing traffic congestion would help reduce VOCs emissions.  102 VOCs were detected by on-road test and the top 40 VOCs accounted for 80%.  Top 5 VOCs emitted by vehicles were hexanal, acetone, toluene, p-xylene and iso-pentane.  Emission factor of gasoline vehicles was 84.2% lower than that of diesel vehicles.  Emission factor under high-speed condition was 55.6% lower than that under low-speed.  VOCs concentrations decreased by 36.9% with the increase in emission standards.

Constant improvement in engine technology has led to significant decrease in the number and mass of emitted PM, but particular concern is raised nowadays by the ultrafine particles. In this context, there is a critical lack of certification procedures for the measurement of the smallest-size (&lt; 23 nm) particulate matter emissions. To support the engine development process as well as future certification procedures, a measurement technology for sub-23 nm particles must be designed. The development of a reliable measurement procedure entails understanding the formation and evolution of particles from the engine to the tailpipe via multiple analytical techniques and theoretical simulations. We present here extensive experimental characterization of ultrafine particles emitted by a gasoline direct injection single-cylinder engine as particle generator. The particles were sampled using a cascade impactor which allows size-separation into 13 different size bins. Chemical characterization of the collected size-selected particles was performed using mass spectrometry, which gives access to detailed molecular information on chemical classes of critical interest such as organosulphates, oxygenated hydrocarbons, nitrogenated hydrocarbons, metals, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Additionally, the morphology of the emitted particles was probed with atomic force (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) was applied for the first time to sub-10 nm combustion-generated particles to gather information on their nanostructure. The extensive database built from these multiple experimental characterizations has been used as input of a theoretical approach to simulate and validate engine out-emissions.

The unpredictable nature of renewable resources is an impediment to developing renewable projects. More reliable, effective, and economically feasible renewable energy systems can be established by consolidating various renewable energy sources such as wind and solar into a hybrid system using batteries or back-up units like conventional energy generators or grids. The precise design of these systems is a critical step toward their effective deployment. An optimal sizing strategy was developed based on a heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique to determine the optimum number and configuration of PV panels, wind turbines, and battery units by minimizing the total system life-cycle cost while maximizing the reliability of the hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) in matching the electricity supply and demand. In addition, by constraining the amount of conventional electricity purchased from the grid, environmental concerns were also considered in the presented method. Various systems with different reliabilities and potential of reducing consumer&apos;s CO2 emissions were designed and the behavior of the proposed method was comprehensively investigated. An HRES may reduce the annualized cost of energy and carbon footprint significantly.

In order to mitigate the negative impact of fluctuations of RES outputs, a smart charging strategy of EVs is presented in this paper. First, a novel uncertainty model using set pair analysis is proposed for the prediction of RES outputs, which provides a different choice of RES modeling method. Second, EVs are modeled as demand-responsive loads by introducing stochastic dynamic pricing. Then, two fluctuation indexes are defined to measure the volatility of RES outputs, and the charging cost is adopted as an economic index for protecting EV users from financial losses. Finally, an optimal charging model is established to minimize the volatility indexes and charging costs. The genetic algorithm is used to solve the model, the seasonality of RES outputs and the spatial-temporal characteristics of EV charging loads are discussed in the simulation under different conditions. Simulations are conducted in the modified IEEE 33 test system, results show that the proposed charging strategy is effective in alleviating the output fluctuations of RESs. The charging cost of EVs can be reduced by 7.6% and 10.3% respectively in winter and summer.  A new uncertainty model of renewable energy sources is proposed.  A unique demand response model of electric vehicles is introduced.  Two fluctuation indexes are defined to measure the volatility.

Bio-ethanol appears as a potential fuel to replace well-established fossil fuels, such as gasoline, due to the overall carbon neutral emission. In addition, the high-octane number allows to increase the compression ratio of the engine to improve the thermal efficiency. Apart from the CO 2 , the emissions legislation restricts the NOx and particle matter emissions to ultra-low values, and they will continue decreasing down to almost zero. In this work, two advanced dual-fuel combustion modes using bio-ethanol as main fuel are studied. A pre-chamber ignition system (PCIS) using bio-ethanol and hydrogen, and a reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion mode operating with bio-ethanol/diesel was selected due to the potential to reduce NO x emissions. These combustion technologies were studied by a numerical 0-D vehicle simulations in homologation and real-life driving cycles for a range extender hybrid powertrain. As a baseline, the original manufacturer spark ignition (SI) no-hybrid powertrain fueled with pure bio-ethanol was used. The powertrain components and control system were optimized to obtain the maximum overall vehicle efficiency, and low CO 2 -NO x emissions. Finally, a life cycle analysis (LCA) was performed to study the global potential of the bio-ethanol to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A battery electric vehicle (BEV) and a gasoline SI no-hybrid vehicle were added for comparison. The results show that the RCCI mode presents the highest potential to reduce the NO x emissions. However, the PCIS allows to reduce the tank to wheel CO 2 emissions up to 60 g/km when high rates of H 2 are used. The LCA-GHG for the vehicles using bio-ethanol is 50% and 95% lower than a BEV and SI-gasoline vehicle, respectively.  The pre-chamber ignition hybrid vehicle achieves the European 2021 CO 2 targets.  The reactivity controlled combustion hybrid vehicle achieves Euro 6 NOx emissions.  Optimum value for the battery capacity at 3.5 kWh for all the range extender concepts.  The dual fuel concepts require the same fuel tank size than the original vehicle.  Ethanol vehicles produce lower greenhouse gas than the electric battery vehicles.

Samples were subject to chemical analysis for various chemical components including water-soluble inorganic ions, carbonaceous species, and elements. The annual average PM 2.5 and PM 10 mass concentrations were, respectively, 32.8 ± 18.9 g m3 and 54.5 ± 29.6 g m3. The highest seasonal average concentrations were found in winter-spring and the lowest in summer due to the seasonal monsoon and gas-particle conversion. The rapid accumulation of vehicle exhaust and the stable existence of NH 4 NO 3 in the ground layer within the urban area contributed to the incremental PM. Sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and organic carbon in PM 2.5 have decreased since 20112013, while elemental carbon increased significantly. This suggests that the motor vehicle and/or ship emissions contributions to PM 2.5 have increased relative to coal combustion over the past five years. The temporal variations of PM and its associated components during the BRICS summit control period further confirmed the important role of traffic related emissions in PM mass. Primary particulates resolved by PMF analysis plus secondary sulfate derived from secondary sulfate formation were estimated to account for 7.56% and 8.31% of PM 2.5 and PM 10 , respectively. Selected heavy metals (As, Cd, Ni, V, Mn, hexavalent Cr, Ba and Pb) originating from ship emissions contributed 64.4% for PM 2.5 and 53.2% for PM 10 of the total non-cancer risk. Carcinogenic risk (lifetime cancer risk) for ship emissions associated with these hazard metals accounted for 50.6% for PM 2.5 and 44.5% for PM 10. Therefore, control measures applied to the ship emissions can benefit the local air quality improvement and reduce health burden to people around the port.

We herein identify the species to be removed primarily from the exhaust of hybrid vehicles to minimize secondary pollutants formation. Pollutants from a conventional (thermal) and a hybrid vehicle are herein evaluated in a chassis dynamometer bench by using two widely used driving cycles, WLTC and FTP75. Hybrid vehicle exhibits the lowest regulated emissions during all the different tests, except for NO x. The results reveal that low and cold start phases of the cycles contribute mainly to the ozone potential, although methane, butadiene and formaldehyde can be emitted at the tailpipe all along the driving cycle. We evidence for the first time a significant contribution of gas-phase reactions to butadiene and methane production inside the exhaust pipe, especially during warm restarts and accelerations. This study indicates that pollutant traps should target primarily monoaromatics which contribute typically to 40% of photochemical ozone creation and 50% to Secondary Organic Aerosols (SOA). However, the contribution of alkanes to ozone differs markedly for the hybrid vehicle, reflecting a different share of ozone production paths with respect to conventional vehicles.

India is one of the developing countries in South Asia where fossil fuelbased power plants make major contributions to electricity generation. In this paper, a detailed review of the challenges faced by electric vehicles is discussed, and an analysis was conducted on the equivalent C emissions from electric vehicles by considering 3 scenarios in India: 1) current electricity generation, 2) power generation considering the installed capacity, and 3) Vision 2022. Based on these 3 scenarios, the main objectives of this work are to understand the potential of electric vehicles to reduce the overall C emissions after considering the indirect C emissions from electricity generation and to highlight the importance of emission control techniques. Experimental investigations of the conversion efficiency of diesel oxidation catalysis (DOC) systems have been conducted for comparative studies. The results of the analysis showed that the indirect C emissions from electric vehicles are higher than the C emissions from internal combustion engines for scenarios 1 and 2. In scenario 3, the C emissions from electric and fossil fuelpowered vehicles are found to be in the same range. The DOC system had an average conversion efficiency of 56% for hydrocarbons and 59% for particle number emissions. The posttreatment emission control systems in internal combustion engines will be the best possible solution, compared to electric vehicles, for reducing overall vehicular emissions until renewable energy sources have a major share in electricity generation.

China has emerged as the global largest EV market with 1.2 million EVs sold in 2018. This study established a novel life cycle energy use and emission inventory collecting up-to-date data including the electricity generation mix, emission controls in the power and industrial sectors, and the energy use in the fuel transport to estimate the well-to-wheels (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG), and air pollutant emissions for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and gasoline passenger vehicles in China. The results show that an average BEV has 35% lower WTW GHG emissions than an average gasoline car. BEVs reduce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions by 98% and 34%, respectively, but have comparable or slightly higher primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. Compact and small-size vehicles generally have lower GHG and air pollutant emissions than mid- and large-size vehicles. Class A vehicles contribute the most in the absolute amount of GHG and air pollutant emissions and therefore have the biggest potential for emission reduction. Our results suggest that global policymakers should continue to promote the transition to clean power sources, emission control, and fuel economy regulations, which are critical to enhancing emission mitigation benefits of BEVs. We also suggest EV development strategies should be formulated targeting vehicle class with the biggest emission mitigation potentials.

The objective was to identify the highest emitters and assess whether PN focus should be extended to engine and fuel types other than diesel and gasoline direct injection (GDI). Results (under the cold-start RDE-compliant route) show that a Euro 6b gasoline vehicle equipped with port fuel injection (PFI) engine, comprised the highest PN emitter (4.5 times higher than the Euro 6 limit of 6 × 1011 p/km), while similar emission levels (up to 3.7 times higher than this limit) were detected in the older-technology (Euro 3 and 4) gasoline and (retrofitted) LPG PFI vehicles. This limit was also exceeded (by 1.7 times) by one gasoline direct injection (GDI) Euro 6b non-GPF vehicle. PN emissions from the hybrid-electric vehicle (equipped with gasoline PFI engine) were lower than the other Euro 6b PFI vehicle, but still high compared to typical PFI engines found in literature. The lowest emissions were detected in diesel and CNG engines (as low as 7.8 × 109 and 2.4 × 1010 p/km respectively). Euro 6b LPG vehicle was found to be a low emitter (3.3 times lower than the 6 × 1011 p/km limit), while similar emission levels were detected in the other Euro 6b non-GPF GDI vehicle. Among the different driving sections (urban, rural, motorway), urban and especially the cold phase had the highest contribution in most cases. Finally, a significant PN reduction potential was observed with LPG and CNG over gasoline (up to 93% and 90% respectively), although the opposite trend was detected in an old-technology retrofitted LPG vehicle. These results indicate that close attention should be focused on other engine and fuel types, apart from diesel and GDI. Regulatory initiatives towards air pollution reduction should include measures for the reduction of high-emission old-technology gasoline and LPG vehicles, while modern gasoline PFI engines should also be further scrutinized.  Gasoline and LPG vehicles, especially the older ones, are the highest polluters.  Diesel (with particulate filter) and CNG vehicles are the lowest.  Significant contribution of urban part, especially cold phase (first 300s) in PN.  Potentially high PN reduction with LPG and CNG over gasoline.  PN focus should be extended beyond diesel and GDI.

During the measuring period, the car was privately used for daily commuting under a natural environment. Detailed in-cabin VOC concentrations, temperature, relative humidity, and air exchange rates were obtained monthly while the car was parked and all windows and doors closed. The influence of in-cabin temperature and car age on the VOC emission rates was explored. For total VOCs, the emission rate was positively associated with the in-cabin temperature and decreased with an increase in vehicle age. For certain VOC species, such as 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 5-methylundecane, and 3,8-dimethyldecane, the emission rates during the summer were 71182 times higher than those during the winter. The influence of vehicle age on the VOC species emission rate depended on the compound properties and emission source characteristics. For aromatics, the decay of the emission rate over time was relatively significant; for alkanes and alkenes, the decay of the emission rate over time was relatively minor; and for ketones and aldehydes and esters and alcohols the emission rate was not necessarily negatively associated with vehicle age. These results aid in understanding vehicle cabin air quality and its possible influential factors.  A long-term field measurement of VOC emissions in a new electric car was conducted.  Emission rates were calculated based on VOC concentrations and ventilation.  VOC emission rate was positively associated with the in-cabin temperature.  Car age&apos;s impact on VOC emission depends on compound properties and source type.

Toxicity levels of exhaust emissions can be reduced by application of pretreatment and posttreatment techniques. Introduction of electric vehicles is considered as the best possible alternative for reducing automotive pollution levels. Requirement for charging infrastructure is one of the major parameters affecting the social acceptance of electric vehicles. Deployment of electric vehicles in countries, which relies primarily on fossil fuels for electricity generation, will only shift the emission threat from vehicle operation phase to energy generation phase. In this article a detailed study has been conducted on the posttreatment emission control strategies for diesel engines and conversion efficiency of platinum based diesel oxidation catalysis system has been investigated with experimental inference. Fossil fuel based energy sources have more than 70% share in electricity generation of India. Additionally, a feasibility study on the deployment of solar based electric vehicle charging stations on the roof of existing fuel stations in Dehradun city, India has been conducted. The results of study showed that the proposed PV system at 26 fuel stations have total energy generation capacity of 1.9 GWh. This indicates that the deployment of solar based charging stations will be an effective method for improving the social acceptance of battery electric vehicles and will also enhance the share of renewable energy sources for power generation.

Understanding the factors affecting consumers&apos; adoption intentions of EVs is vital to the diffusion of EVs. This study aims to identify factors that can encourage consumers to adopt EVs from both internal and external perspectives. We examined three types of policies for EVs formulated by the Chinese government since 2010. Aiming to understand consumers&apos; perceptions of these policies and their impacts on adoption intentions, a survey was sent to potential vehicle consumers in urban China. The survey asked respondents about their cognitions of EVs, including environmental performance and vehicle property, and their perceptions toward three types of incentive policies and their adoption intentions. Results show that consumers&apos; adoption intentions of EVs are determined by product cognition toward EVs and perceptions of incentive policies. Respondents&apos; perceptions of policies are also diverse when grouped according to different demographic characteristics. Women, the elders, and those with lower income exhibit higher acceptance and interest in the policies than their counterparts. Our results are meaningful to policy makers and companies interested in targeting at certain groups and guiding consumers toward clean vehicle technologies.  EVs show great potential in reducing carbon emissions and alleviating air pollution.  Consumers&apos; policy perceptions are diverse due to the different demographic features.

Also, exhaust gases from these vehicles are degrading the environment by increasing the content of greenhouse gases. To combat these issues, the electric vehicles (EVs) are emerging as a new mode of transportation. In recent research articles, the EV charging stations (EVCSs) are consuming power from either the grid or a solar grid system. If the EV is charged from grid, then it should not be considered environment-friendly as grid power is mostly generated by burning coal. In the long run, if EVs come in bulk grids, they would get overloaded, thus affecting the power quality. The efficient energy management of sources available for charging is mandatory for the persistence of these vehicles. The paper aims to rectify energy crisis by suggesting alternative sources for energising the EVCS. A new hybrid system consisting of PV, WTG and fuel cells is proposed. This system is independent of the grid supply. Hence, even with increasing inrush of EVs, the power quality of grid will not suffer. In this paper, an exhaustive review of different topologies of power converters for EVCS and their comparison are carried out. Furthermore, envisaging the future of RES for the charging station to ensure sustainable development.

Although different types of EVs are available on the market, the largest contribution to the reduction of environmental problems could be made through zeroemission vehicles, such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). Each of these vehicles has some advantages and disadvantages. The problem they share is the high purchase price in comparison to conventional gasoline vehicles. Through the improvement of battery performance, further technological learning and a mix of different direct and indirect supporting policy measures, the competiveness of EVs could be significantly improved. EVs could already contribute to the reduction of emissions today, however the full environmental benefit of BEVs and FCVs is related to the mix of the primary energy sources used for electricity generation and hydrogen production. The increasing use of renewable energy sources in electricity generation makes EVs more environmentally friendly. Since total emissions are also dependent on the embedded emissions of cars, their lifetime as well as their usage (specific vehicle kilometers driven per year) have significant impacts on the total emissions per km driven.

In this study, four scenarios were developed to understand how future fleet electrification and turnover of both gasoline and diesel vehicles affect air quality and health in the Houston Metropolitan area. These scenarios considered increased vehicle activity and various configurations of emissions controls. Comparing to a base year of 2013, model predictions for 2040 indicated a 50% emissions increase in the Business As Usual (BAU) case, and 50%, 75%, and 95% reductions in the three distinct emissions control cases, the Moderate Electrification (ME), Aggressive Electrification (AE), and Complete Turnover (CT) cases, respectively. Each modeling scenario was conducted using a high-resolution (1 km) WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ-BenMAP air quality and health modeling framework, which helped capture urban features in higher detail. The emissions control cases resulted in 14 ppb maximum 8 h O 3 increase along highways and reductions both in the regions enclosed by the highways and those downwind. Simulated PM 2.5 concentrations decreased between 0.5 and 2 g m3. Health impact results suggest that increased O 3 and PM 2.5 concentrations from the BAU case will lead to 122 additional premature deaths with respect to 2013. However, reduced emissions for the control cases (ME, AE, CT) will prevent 114246 premature deaths. Additionally, about 7,500 asthma exacerbation and 5,500 school loss days will be prevented in the ME case, benefiting younger individuals. The economic benefits generally followed the same trends as health impacts. The analysis framework developed in this study can be applied to other metropolitan areas. The effects of motor vehicle electrification on power plant emissions were estimated using the Argonne National Laboratory&apos;s Autonomie data, and indicated the electrification load to be negligible as opposed to projected electricity generation. Highlights  Developed emissions scenarios that correspond to varying degrees of fleet electrification and turnover in Houston.  Emission controls lead to 14 ppb change of ozone and 0.52 g m3 decrease of PM 2.5.  Calculated the change in premature deaths and other health outcomes using BenMAP.

The intensity of these events is usually justified, although somewhat vaguely. Based on the implementation of new technologies to certain production processes, we analyse the economic impacts of a replacement in the energy supply, from classical to renewable sources. In particular, this work focuses on the pig sector, due to its relatively high off-grid energy use, taking Aragon (Northern Spain) as a case study because of the significance of the sector in this region. A partial equilibrium approach to evaluate this replacement is first addressed. This partial analysis provides the intensity level of the impact of the change. On the basis of these data, the impact of the energy replacement is simulated using a Computable General Equilibrium model developed for the regional economy of Aragon. Findings show a slight increase in (pig) production and exports, and suggest the convenience of combining partial equilibrium analysis, which involves a mix of engineering and economic issues, to estimate the endogenous increase in efficiency, with general equilibrium models. Highlights  Economic impacts of replacing classical energy with renewable sources are addressed.  Partial equilibrium analysis is combined with a general equilibrium model.

Transport operators, planners and policymakers are constantly searching for low-cost solutions to such transport issues. Therefore, it is critical to developing an environmentally sustainable and economically viable efficient traffic network to relieve traffic pressure (i.e., traffic congestion, transport infrastructure investment needs). The objective of this research is to propose a &quot;Soft Traffic Management (STM)&quot; concept to proactively analyse the traffic impact of transport planning strategy before implementation. This study investigates the effectiveness of a STM for easing the traffic pressure by carrying out a pilot research project on the proposed South East Busway extension in Logan City, Australia, by employing a stepwise process consisting of a multi-stage analysis and stakeholder-based modelling approach. The results indicate that the extended busway can significantly relieve traffic congestion. In addition, the proposed strategy has significantly positive impacts on the environment since it aims to reduce air pollution and fuel consumption as well as to improve the safety and efficiency of the whole transport system. This study confirms the effects of STM on improving the use of existing infrastructure more efficiently and deferring future transport infrastructure investments. Highlights  Soft Traffic Management (STM) can significantly relieve traffic congestion.  STM can make urban mobility more environmentally friendly.  STM can reduce demand for private motor vehicle travel.  STM can reduce fuel consumption and air pollution.  STM can defer infrastructure investment by increasing existing transport efficiency.

Extensive measurements of PM 2.5 , eBC, and CO were carried out inside the system buses and stations. Measurements were performed during eleven months covering all the system lanes and a significant fraction of the bus fleet and stations. Based on the observed in-bus and in-station concentrations, travel times, and urban ambient levels, the contribution of a typical round trip in the BRT system to the daily inhaled dose was estimated to be 60% for PM 2.5 , and between 79% and 90% for eBC. The mean PM 2.5 dose inhaled by commuters in a typical round trip in the system is 1.2 times the dose a subject would inhale over 24 h exposed to WHO guideline of 25  g m  3 . In 52 out of 180 buses sampled the mean in-cabin concentration of e BC was in excess of 100  g m  3 . Measurements show that mean ratio of in-bus to urban ambient concentration is 8:1 for PM 2.5 and 4:1 for CO. These ratios were observed to be much larger when traveling inside the older fraction of the BRT fleet, reaching 11:1 and 7:1 for PM 2.5 and CO respectively. These older buses consist exclusively of Euro II and Euro III nominal emission standard vehicles. Average exposure levels inside Euro II and III buses was twice as large as those measured inside vehicles with stricter emission standards, Euro IV or superior. Overall, the measurements suggest that the entrainment of polluted pockets of air to the semi enclosed micro-environments in the system, namely, buses and stations, explains the extreme observed exposure concentrations. Measurements inside an underground bus-station where traffic is restricted to only BRT buses, and on-board a zero emission fully electric BRT bus suggested most of the pollution in the system comes from entrainment of the exhaust of the diesel-powered BRT buses. The significantly lower exposure and inhaled dose of PM 2.5 , e BC , and CO observed for commuters in newer vehicles suggests that a fleet renewal could have a disproportionately large impact on reducing population exposure to air pollutants. The extent of the reduction in exposure and inhaled dose through fleet renewal is proportional to the gradient of in-bus to urban ambient air pollution levels. Highlights  Concentrations of air pollutants were measured in one of the world largest Bus Rapid Transit Systems (BRT).  Extremely high Black Carbon, PM 2.5 , and CO concentrations were observed inside buses and stations.  The dose of PM 2.5 experienced during a typical round-trip in the BRT system contributes 60% to the daily inhaled dose.  In-cabin concentrations were twice as large for commuters in Euro II or III buses compared to those in Euro IV or V.  A fleet renovation could have disproportionate effects on reducing commuters&apos; exposure.

Though approved as a general pathway, EPA has proposed multiple credit allocation methods to functionalize this pathway. This study describes and evaluates a potential credit allocation framework where vehicle manufacturers generate electricity RIN (ERIN) credits and use these credits to increase the sales of plugin electric vehicles (PEVs). Under this framework, manufacturers use part of the credit value to reimburse electricity generators, offsetting potential higher biogas electricity generation cost. The remaining credit value is passed on to consumers as an annual PEV rebate to stimulate PEV sales. An iterative simulation framework is developed to fulfill two tasks: (a) to estimate the annual rebate amounts and their upfront value to consumers based on various factors, such as vehicle mileage, ERIN equivalence value, and biogas capacity, and (b) to evaluate potential impacts of the ERIN program on electrification of the future lightduty vehicles (LDVs) and energy use. The annual rebate amount varies by vehicle technology and could be up to $870/year for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and range between $230 and 825/year for plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) depending on the electric range. These per vehicle rebates decrease when demand for electricity exceeds biogas electricity availability. The effectiveness of the program as modeled here is subject to different factors, such as the ERIN equivalence value, biogas electricity generation cost, biogas electricity generation capacity, and consumers&apos; valuation of the ERIN rebate. Our modeling results indicate that an ERIN program has the potential to produce nearly $12 billion in ERIN credits annually and to significantly increase PEV annual sales by up to 2.3 million and the PEV population by about 19.7 million in 2030. This study evaluated a potential annual rebate credit allocation framework and estimated how the program could stimulate plugin electric vehicle (PEV) technology adoption. With the biogastoelectricity pathway under the Renewable Fuel Standard, credits could be generated if electricity is produced from the biogas and used in transportation. The credits are traded in the market and have monetary values. When applied to PEVs, these credits could potentially affect PEV ownership. Our modeled results assessing this possible impact indicate that the program has the potential to produce nearly $12 billion in credits annually and could significantly increase PEV adoption by 2030.

Traditional methods for estimating source impacts that employ receptor models are limited by the availability of observational data. To better estimate temporally and spatially resolved mobile source impacts on PM2.5, we developed an approach based on a method that uses elemental carbon (EC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxide (NOx) measurements as an indicator of mobile source impacts. We extended the original integrated mobile source indicator (IMSI) method in three aspects. First, we generated spatially resolved indicators using 24-hr average concentrations of EC, CO, and NOx estimated at 4 km resolution by applying a method developed to fuse chemical transport model (Community Multiscale Air Quality Model [CMAQ]) simulations and observations. Second, we used spatially resolved emissions instead of county-level emissions in the IMSI formulation. Third, we spatially calibrated the unitless indicators to annually-averaged mobile source impacts estimated by the receptor model Chemical Mass Balance (CMB). Daily total mobile source impacts on PM2.5, as well as separate gasoline and diesel vehicle impacts, were estimated at 12 km resolution from 2002 to 2008 and 4 km resolution from 2008 to 2010 for Georgia. The total mobile and separate vehicle source impacts compared well with daily CMB results, with high temporal correlation (e.g., R ranges from 0.59 to 0.88 for total mobile sources with 4 km resolution at nine locations). The total mobile source impacts had higher correlation and lower error than the separate gasoline and diesel sources when compared with observation-based CMB estimates. Overall, the enhanced approach provides spatially resolved mobile source impacts that are similar to observation-based estimates and can be used to improve assessment of health effects. Implications: An approach is developed based on an integrated mobile source indicator method to estimate spatiotemporal PM2.5 mobile source impacts. The approach employs three air pollutant concentration fields that are readily simulated at 4 and 12 km resolutions, and is calibrated using PM2.5 source apportionment modeling results to generate daily mobile source impacts in the state of Georgia. The estimated source impacts can be used in investigations of traffic pollution and health.

CO exposure was measured during four field surveys on State Route #82 (El Camino Real) on the San Francisco Peninsula in 1980-1981, 1991-1992, 2001-2002, and 2010-2011. Each field survey took at least 12 months. Fifty trips from each surveyfor a total of 200 tripswere matched by date, day of the week, and starting time of the day to facilitate comparisons over three decades. The mean net CO concentration of each trip was obtained by subtracting the background CO level from the average CO concentration for the entire trip. The mean net CO concentration (0.5 ppm) for 2010-2011 was only 5.2% of that (9.7 ppm) for 1980-1981. For the 50 trips, the average travel time for the 1980-1981 period (39.6 min) was only 8.3% higher than during the 2010-2011 period (36.3 min). The estimated round-trip distance on the highway was held constant at 11.8 miles. The reduction in the mean net CO concentration was attributed to more stringent CO emission standards on new vehicles sold in California since 1980. The state&apos;s cold-temperature CO standard implemented in 1996 appeared to reduce high CO concentrations that were observed during the late fall and winter of 1980-1981. In addition, the observed standard deviation in concentration fell from 3.1 ppm in 1980-1981 to 0.2 ppm in 2010-2011, and the range of the 50 mean net CO concentrations narrowed from 14.9 ppm in 1980-1981 to 1.1 ppm in 2010-2011, but the relative variability, as indicated by the geometric standard deviation, remained the same. These results have important scientific implications for regulatory policies designed to control air pollution from motor vehicles. Implications: Many developing countries launched or expanded their mobile source emission control programs in the 1990s, yet many of them do not have adequate inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs. The El Camino Real study shows the long-term public health benefits of more stringent motor vehicle emission standards for carbon monoxide (CO) on new cars and of an I/M program (Smog Check) on the existing fleet in California. The study provides a protocol for conducting standardized field surveys of in-vehicle exposure on a periodic basis. Such surveys would enable developing countries to assess the progress of their mobile source emission control programs.

Many governments aim to encourage the uptake of EVs in cities, because urban areas are well suited to EV driving ranges and stand to benefit hugely from reduced local emissions. In the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC), where clean renewable electricity sourcing makes EV deployment an attractive proposition, over a quarter of residents live in Multi-Unit Residential Buildings (MURBs), most of which are not equipped with EV charging infrastructure. In a related study, Lopez-Behar et al. (accepted) explored the challenges and decision-making processes involved in the installation of EV charging infrastructure in MURBs in BC, from the perspective of different stakeholders. Here, we build on those findings to map out and analyze feedback loops within this system using a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD). We then present potential demand-focused policy interventions to address the issues raised by our modelling results, grouped into three categories: financial/fiscal, regulatory and information/awareness measures. Financial/fiscal policy measures include creating incentives for EV owners and extending them to the building owners, and programs to incentivize and provide financial aid for building owners to develop building retrofit plans. Regulatory policy measures include addressing the rights and obligations of the stakeholders and making mandatory the installation of charging stations in new MURBs. Information/awareness policy measures include expanding the existing guidelines and informing the development of a long-term EV charging infrastructure plan. Our policy recommendations are designed to inform the interventions of municipal and provincial governments in BC, but could also be relevant to many urban EV markets worldwide. Highlights  Widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) requires adequate home charging infrastructure.  Installing such infrastructure in Multi-Unit Residential Buildings (MURBs) is challenging.  We use a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) to analyze feedbacks when installing EV infrastructure in MURBs.  We present demand-focused policy interventions to address issues highlighted by our model.  Our policy recommendations are applicable to urban EV markets worldwide.

To achieve some good performance of the V2G and power system, this paper proposes a cooptimizing method based on the operation of V2G control and load frequency control (LFC). Compared with the existed results, the proposed method that deals with dead bands and statistical properties of power imbalance in power system establishes a model of twoarea V2G system containing the nonlinear features in the beginning. Based on the proposed model, the composition of power imbalance is analyzed, while the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is employed to obtain active power imbalance scenarios caused by the probability distribution of load disturbance and renewable energy source in each area. Because the active power imbalance scenarios are considered and the cost function is constructed by the integration of integral time multiply absolute error (ITAE), the droop coefficients of V2G control and proportionalintegral (PI) controllers of LFC that are cooptimized simultaneously maintain the demand of holding state of charge (SOC) from EV owners and frequency regulation of V2G system. Finally, simulation results show the validity and advantage of the proposed method.

Renewable energy sources, PV, energy storage systems and bidirectional electricity exchange with the buildings and the grid are taken into account. The considered energy scheme, Building to Vehicle to Building, is analysed by including both buildings and mobility consumptions in the energy balance. Three different management system scenarios, designed to analyse the role of electric vehicles as electricity vector among buildings integrating PV panels and electrical storages, are analysed through a case study analysis. To this aim, a dynamic simulation model, implemented in MatLab, is suitably developed for the assessment of the energy demands and loads of the building, as a function of the considered electric vehicles energy use patterns. Simulation results show that the proposed energy management systems improves the building grid reliance and the grid electricity consumption is remarkably reduced up to 45% and 77% depending on the proposed scenarios.

It is a comprehensive solution, which is capable of automatically managing and controlling smallscale renewable energy generation facilities and energy storage system including batteries and plugin vehicles, and household smart appliances in flexible cooperation with advanced metering infrastructure to deliver timebased price messages from utilities to the end users. Therefore, the multivariable singleobjective optimisation scheme by genetic algorithm is proposed to reshape the enduser&apos;s consumption profile according to the available generation, grid requests, and consumer&apos;s preferences, while simultaneously helping to compensate for the volatility of output power in renewable energy sources alongside a local energy storage system. The approach aims to minimise the overall daily electricity cost of household appliances and keep the power consumption below a demand limit. The obtained simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed residential load scheduling algorithm, which has proven to be effective in optimising the consumer comfort level by maximising the operation of the household appliances within the preferred comfort level mode and minimising their operation in the allowable comfort level mode. The results also show that when the energy storage system includes a plugin electric vehicle as storage, the level of violation is reduced close to the original settings compared with when the electric vehicle battery is not used as energy storage.

Adapting agricultural machinery, e.g., raising the use of electric vehicles (EVs), is one way of meeting such challenges. Although interest in EVs and sustainable farming is becoming ever stronger, in practice the usage of EVs still remains at a relatively low level. As EV experience is key in deciding for or against e-mobility, the present paper focuses on the differences in perceptions between experienced and non-experienced electric vehicle users. The present study was conducted in the course of a pilot project on e-mobility in rural Austrian regions. Three hundred and thirty-four farmers were asked to assess the performance of 13 attributes regarding e-cars and agricultural EVs. While none of the selected attributes were deemed unimportant, there were clear differences in perceptions between those with and without EV experience. For example, farmers with experience were more satisfied with the performance of current EVs than those without experience. Availability of a private charging station for agricultural EVs is seen as important by both groups, but experienced farmers rate the respective importance, and also satisfaction with private charging stations significantly higher than farmers without experience. The results show that specific policy adaptations have to be made in order to increase the acceptance of EVs in the agriculture sector.Graphical abstract: [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]</td><td>01-janv.-19</td><td>55-67</td><td>1</td><td>21</td><td>Clean Technologies &amp; Environmental Policy</td><td></td><td>8gh</td><td></td><td>EBSCOhost</td><td></td><td>Electric vehicles; Renewable energy sources; Energy consumption; Sustainable development; Agriculture; Consumer behavior; E-mobility; Importance-performance analysis; Perception gap</td></tr>

A cascade combination of integer order integralderivative with filter (IDN) and fractional order proportional derivative (FOPD) is considered as a secondary controller (IDNFOPD). The controller gains and other parameters are optimized using whale optimization algorithm. The performance of IDNFOPD controller has an upper hand when compared with some classical controllers like integral, proportionalintegral, and proportionalintegralderivative with filter (PIDN). Analyses reveal that the performance of a combination of IDNFOPD in area1 and PIDN controllers in other areas of system dynamics provides comparable results with IDNFOPD controllers in all areas. Thus, this combination of controllers is carried for further analyses. Even eigenvalue analysis has been performed for analyzing system stability. The impact of time delay on system dynamics is also studied. The impact of the inclusion of renewable source like a solar thermal power plant in area1 and electric vehicles in all areas provides better system dynamics in the presence of nonlinearity generation rate constraint and time delay. Sensitivity analysis reveals that controller gains and other parameters obtained at nominal conditions are robust to changes in variable solar insolation and demands no further reset.

By modifying a DC optimal power flow model using a linearised approximation for ohmic losses, the authors were able to understand which network characteristic or inhibitor drives the most change in expanding utility-scale storage. Four different storage technologies were explored: compressed air energy storage, pumped hydro storage, lithium-ion battery and fly wheel. Each had different charging, capacity and cost characteristics. The results of the storage allocation trials revealed that network congestion was a more influential network inhibitor than were line losses. Losses only had substantial effects on a free-flowing network but produced marginal changes in allocation in congested ones. The conclusion of the investment trials revealed two things: (i) storage investment is not significantly affected by transmission constraints so long as renewable generation stays constant and relatively low,(ii) more flexible technologies like flywheels are favoured at lower volumes of renewable penetration for their load balancing capabilities while cheaper technologies are best as the volume of renewable power generated increases.

Yet, mainly due to their high costs, especially in the case of pure battery electric vehicles, and a lack of proper infrastructure, the use of EVs is still very limited. In this paper, some of the major barriers and the future challenges are discussed. The current problems are mainly attributed to two categories: (1) the battery performances and costs, as well as battery production including issue of material availability and (2) environmental benefits of EVs depending on the sources used for the electricity generation and their carbon intensity. The major conclusions are that (1) research and development with respect to batteries has by far the highest priority and (2) it has to be ensured that the electricity used in EVs is generated largely from renewable energy sources.

In the last years, the battery costs of electric vehicles have dropped faster than previously estimated in the empirical literature. As a result, future cost projections have been adjusted. The larger than expected reduction in costs also shows the uncertainty of battery cost development, which will affect the success of a transition to low-carbon transport. Integrated assessment models show that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is more challenging in the transport sector than in other sectors. Switching to EVs could significantly reduce passenger road-transport emissions. In this study, we test the sensitivity of the projected sales of EVs to different battery costs and climate policy futures. The model suggests that the effectiveness of policy incentives will strongly depend on the battery floor costs, as EVs only gain significant shares (15% or more) of global car sales within our model framework when battery costs reach 100 $/kWh or less. We therefore conclude that besides the pace of the battery costs decline, which has been rapid in the last years, it is important to understand the lower boundary of battery costs for modelling long-term global energy transitions.

This paper reviews the factors that can directly and indirectly influence the economics of the public charging infrastructure. The knowledge gaps, barriers and opportunities in the development of the charging infrastructure have been identified and analyzed. In order to promote the development of the public charging infrastructure, more research efforts should be paid on the impacts of psychological factors of customers and the technical development of charging infrastructures and EV batteries. The government support has been proved to play an important role, so that how the government policy can be tailored for the development of the charging infrastructure market should receive more attentions. In addition, the charging price as an endogenous factor should be considered more carefully in modelling the charging infrastructure market. New business models are also urgently needed to accelerate the future development of the public charging infrastructure.

Unfortunately, price, range, infrastructure and technological uncertainty are only some of the barriers to a faster adoption of these vehicles. To overcome these barriers, there is a broad call for public support and a growing body of primarily survey and choice experiment studies to show which policy mechanisms are effective, with mixed outcomes. In response, this paper offers a qualitative comparative analysis that draws on 227 semi-structured interviews with 257 transportation and electricity experts from 201 institutions across 17 cities within the Nordic region to discuss the reasoning and arguments behind EV incentives and policy mechanisms. A frequency analysis of the most coded responses favoured cost reduction mechanisms, in particular taxation exemptions; infrastructure support for public and apartment charging; the importance of consumer awareness, especially information campaigns; certain other specific policy measures like procurement programs and environmental zones; and more general policy principles. More in-depth, our analysis shows the debates around these mechanisms and how the pros and cons of these mechanisms differ per country, per transport segment, per phase of transition or market share, even per city. In short, this paper calls for strong stable national targets and price incentives combined with local flexibility to implement secondary benefits and more attention to awareness campaigns to advance the implementation of electric vehicles.

This renovation will require huge amounts of raw materials, some of them with high supply risks. To assess such risks a new methodology is proposed, identifying possible bottlenecks of future demand versus geological availability. This has been applied to the world development of wind power, solar photovoltaic, solar thermal power and passenger electric vehicles for the 20162050 time period under a business as usual scenario considering the impact on 31 different raw materials. As a result, 13 elements were identified to have very high or high risk, meaning that these could generate bottlenecks in the future: cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, gallium, indium, lithium, manganese, nickel, silver, tellurium, tin and zinc. Tellurium, which is mostly demanded to manufacture solar photovoltaic cells, presents the highest risk. To overcome these constraints, measures consisting on improving recycling rates from 0.1% to 4.6% per year could avoid material shortages or restrictions in green technologies. For instance, lithium recycling rate should increase from 1% to 4.8% in 2050. This study aims to serve as a guideline for developing eco-design and recycling strategies.

Vehicle emission factors (EFs), including fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), NO-NO 2 -NO x , and carbon monoxide (CO), were measured (August 4-18, 2017) in an urban tunnel in Tianjin, northern China. The average EFs (mg km 1 veh 1 ) of the fleet were as follows: 9.21 (95% confidence interval: 1.60, 23.07) for PM 2.5 , 62.08 (21.21, 138.25) for NO, 20.42 (0.79, 45.48) for NO 2 , 83.72 (26.29, 162.87) for NO x , and 284.54 (18.22, 564.67) for CO. The fleet-average EFs exhibited diurnal variations, due to diurnal variations in the proportion of HDDVs in the fleet, though the hourly proportion of HDDVs never exceeded 10% during the study period. The reconstructed average EFs for on-road vehicle emissions of PM 2.5 , NO, NO 2 , and NO x , and CO were approximately 2.2, 1.7, 1.5, 2.0, and 1.6 times as much as those in the tunnel, respectively, due to the higher HDDV fractions in the whole city than those in the tunnel. The EFs of PM 2.5 , NO, NO 2 , and NO x , and CO from each HDDV were approximately 75, 81, 24, 65, and 33 times of those from each non-HDDV, respectively. HDDVs were responsible for approximately 81.92%, 83.02%, 59.79%, 79.79%, and 66.77% of the total PM 2.5 , NO, NO 2 , and NO x , and CO emissions from on-road vehicles in Tianjin, respectively. DVs, especially HDDVs, are major sources of on-road PM 2.5 , NO-NO 2 -NO x , and CO emissions in northern China. The contribution of HDDVs to fleet emissions calculated by the EFs from Chinese on-road vehicle emission inventory guidebook were underestimated, as compared to our results. The EFs from on-road vehicles should be updated due to the rapid progression of vehicle technology combined with emission standards in China. The management and control of HDDV emissions have become urgent to reduction of on-road vehicle emissions.

They enable significant to very deep (98%) reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, where large reductions depend on the extent that the Australian electricity generation will eventually use renewable energy. Fuel cell vehicles appear not to have the same benefits as battery electric vehicles. They perform only slightly better than conventional fossil-fuelled vehicles in terms of energy use per km. In contrast, EVs use approximately a factor of 3-5 times less energy. In fact, fuel cell vehicles are expected to produce a large increase in greenhouse gas emission of about a factor of two, but have the potential to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the long term, but only on the strict condition that Australia significantly increases its use of renewable energy. EVs and fuel cell vehicles are both expected to significantly improve local air quality, particularly in urban areas where population and associated transport needs are concentrated. Flowever, the extent to which renewable energy is used, is again an important factor in relation to level of improvement that will be achieved. The economic case for EVs is strong. The (hidden) economic costs of air pollution and associated public health impacts caused by fossil-fuelled vehicles will be substantially reduced. Total cost&apos; parity (purchase plus operating) with conventional vehicles is expected to occur in the early to mid 2020s. In contrast to other regions in the world, Australia has a relatively sluggish track record in EV promotion and uptake, mainly due to a lack of supportive policies. New Zealand and some jurisdictions in Australia have taken a significantly more active stance regarding EVs. It is prudent that Australia does the same given the current transformation towards connected and autonomous vehicles (AVs) where electric vehicles are considered to be the &apos;natural partner&apos; of AVs. EVs can help a transition to a more renewable energy system as relatively cheap energy storage devices. So where are we heading with electric vehicles? Although there are significant differences between countries and regions in the world, the available data suggest we are definitely heading away from fossil-fuelled road transport towards a fully transformed road transport system where electric vehicles will dominate, or at least play a key role. Electric vehicles are the obvious choice when considering environmental and economic benefits. Other fundamental shifts such as autonomous vehicles and renewable energy are mutually reinforcing developments. Co-development with a clean and climatefriendly electricity generation system will enable deep cuts in greenhouse and air pollution emissions.

The main feature of this scheme is that it provides uninterrupted daytime charging at a constant price. In order to simulate the system, the models of PV output power, EV power demand, state of charge (SOC) estimation of energy storage unit (ESU) and grid electricity prices are developed. The uninterrupted and constant price charging is achieved by managing the energy flow between PV, ESU and grid according to the rules defined by REMS. Furthermore, the valley-filling operation is implemented during the grid off-peak hours. The resiliency of REMS is validated under various weather conditions, different ESU prices and at grid parities. For comparison, its performance is benchmarked against the standard grid-based EV charging. The results demonstrate a decline in charging price by 16.1% besides reducing the burden on the grid by 93.7% with the implementation of REMS. In addition, the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology is incorporated in the charging system to improve the payback schedule of the existing PV-grid system.

These measurements were made in eight cities (Chengdu, Urumqi, Jinan, Nanjing, Lanzhou, Harbin, Guangzhou) with varying sizes of NGV fleet. A traffic CH 4 :CO 2 emission ratio (TER) was determined via linear regression of CH 4 versus CO 2 concentration data obtained from each street transect. The TER value was combined with the ratio of NGVs in the street traffic in a mathematical model to obtain the CH 4 emission factor for NGVs. Results show that the TER increases with increasing NGV ratio and decreases with increasing traffic speed. Overall, the NGV CH 4 emission factor in these cities is 0.022±0.0033kgm 3 , about 8 times the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default factor for NGVs and is more than 100% higher than the mean NGV tailpipe emission factor found in the published literature. That the overall emission factor is much larger than the tailpipe emission factor indicates that on-road vehicle gas leakage is a widespread problem. A business-as-usual scenario suggests that NGVs may emit 1.23Tg CH 4 yr 1 in 2030, or about 3% of China&apos;s current total anthropogenic emission. Our study suggest that curbing the emissions from this sector should be a high priority for global climate mitigation efforts.

The rise of the potential of this industry has since led to a plethora of studies on resonant converter topologies with the aim to enhance the features of soft switching, high power density, smooth waveforms and high efficiency. The efficiency of these converters has been proven, thus are undoubtedly favored over hard switching conventional converters because of their ability to both work at high frequency and reduce switching losses. Researches are still being continued to significantly reduce the cost and number of components, besides improving areas such as high power density, high efficiency, wide load variations, and reliability. This paper presents the principles of resonant power converters (RPCs) and their classifications based on their DC-DC converter family, and ability to achieve soft switching. Several recent research trends have focused on the development of their constructions, operational principles, merits and demerits. The study of different resonant DCDC converter topologies suggests that there is no single topology which can achieve all requirements. Therefore, further research is required to produce a power circuit that can eliminate the addressed limitations as many as possible.

This study provides a comprehensive review of the effects of EVs adoption on air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and human health. Specifically, we (i) synthesized relevant published literature related to environmental implication of EVs, (ii) quantitatively evaluated the effect of EVs on environment and human health, and (iii) identified research gaps and recommend future research areas for the adoption of EVs and their benefits to society. We assessed in total 4734 studies and selected 123 articles of more detailed review, with 65 articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria. The studies reviewed consistently showed reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and emissions of some criteria pollutants. Particularly on PM and SO 2 , the increases or decreases are very dependent on the context. Overall, the positive benefits of EVs for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and human exposure depends on the following factors: (i) type of EV, (ii) source of energy generation, (iii) driving conditions, (iv) charging patterns, (v) availbailty of charging infrastructure, (vi) govermnat policies, and (vii) climate of a regions.

Although electric vehicles are considered zero emission vehicles, their use may be linked to indirect pollution of environment caused by energy sources used for electricity production and also other sources of pollution such as poor recycling procedures. A computer simulation was performed to determine the energy consumption of electric vehicles available on the Romanian car market. The values obtained were correlated with emissions of CO2, NOx and SOx pollutants. Furthermore, a supplementary analysis was performed to determine the necessary combination and related management of energy sources to minimize the environmental impact of electric vehicles, in order to increase their use for a future sustainable transportation domain. The study shows that SOx emissions in particular will increase in Romania alone, as a result of the implementation of electric cars, unless alternative and renewable energy sources are implemented in the society. This study reports crucial statistics and information which outline that legislative policies must be in place before a full implementation of electric vehicles is carried out, in order to avoid increase in emissions countries without the direct access to renewable energy resources.

Fully aware of the interaction between the market diffusion of PEVs and charging infrastructures, China&apos;s central government has issued a series of policies to promote a national charging network; this is among the largest deployment programmes in the world. Following the elaboration of China&apos;s targets for charging infrastructure deployment by 2020, there are related topics including charging pricing policies, standardisation of the charging infrastructures, renovations of the power system, and incentives for PEV adoption. A comprehensive understanding of the deployment process will help achieve the challenging goal. Therefore, related methodologies for fundamental issues in the process, which are charging technology, allocation optimisation, and smart charging management, respectively, are systematically reviewed. Furthermore, the barriers in the near-term deployment process are discussed and analysed focusing on the efficiency of these policies. Analytical results show that, while the major challenge lies in the profit expectation of the infrastructure investor sector, the design of subsidies for PEVs and chargers should be strengthened and well-balanced at the initial stage. Also, outlooks for China&apos;s future energy projections demonstrate the feasibility of providing massive PEVs with low-carbon electricity.

Although emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) are usually measured at the exhaust, emissions in the gas phase of lower volatility compounds (POA vapor ) are not. However, these gas-phase emissions may be oxidised after emission and enhance the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). They are shown here to contribute to most of the SOA formation in Central Paris. POA vapor emissions are usually estimated from primary organic aerosol emissions in the particle phase (POA). However, they could also be estimated from VOC emissions for both gasoline and diesel vehicles using previously published measurements from chamber measurements. Estimating POA vapor from VOC emissions and ageing exhaust emissions with a simple model included in the Polyphemus air-quality platform compare well to measurements of SOA formation performed in chamber experiments. Over Greater Paris, POA vapor emissions estimated using POA and VOC emissions are compared using the HEAVEN bottom-up traffic emissions model. The impact on the simulated atmospheric concentrations is then assessed using the Polyphemus/Polair3D chemistry-transport model. Estimating POA vapor emissions from VOC emissions rather than POA emissions lead to lower emissions along motorway axes (between 50% and 70%) and larger emissions in urban areas (up to between +120% and +140% in Central Paris). The impact on total organic aerosol concentrations (gas plus particle) is lower than the impact on emissions: between 8% and 25% along motorway axes and in urban areas respectively. Particle-phase organic concentrations are lower when POA vapor emissions are estimated from VOC than POA emissions, even in Central Paris where the total organic aerosol concentration is higher, because of different assumptions on the emission volatility distribution, stressing the importance of characterizing not only the emission strength, but also the emission volatility distribution.

Road transport is the main emitter of nitrogen oxides (NO x ), as the National Inventory of Air Emissions 2006 stated. Actually, it is responsible for the emissions of 59.8% of NO x and 28% of carbon monoxide (CO). The number of households owning a car in Uruguay increased from 29% in 2005 to 39% in 2013, enhancing the importance of characterizing the vehicular emissions of the national fleet. In this paper, a first approach for this characterization is presented. It was carried out on a sample of 11 light vehicles currently in use in Montevideo city, Uruguay. On-road emissions measurements of nitrogen monoxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) were carried out for calculating the emission factors. The fitness of the set of calculated emission factors values to different probability distributions was tested. When possible, the 95% confidence intervals were obtained for the mean emission factors (CO: 2.0 g/km ± 0.3 g/km; NO: 0.05 g/km ± 0.01 g/km). This procedure was useful to obtaining accurate confidence intervals from a relatively small sample size. Finally, the link between atmospheric emissions and some other parameters of the tested vehicles was studied using a multivariate statistical tool, highlighting the strong increase in carbon monoxide emissions observed for low vehicles speeds and fuel efficiencies.

Subsequent engine calibration and installation of a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) device were conducted and tested on a fully transient engine dyno setup, which precisely reproduced the engine operation under the on-road RDE test. The NO x reduction achieved with those upgrades was 90%, leading to a CF of 0.53, with no CO 2 or fuel consumption penalty.

To evaluate how the transition to EVs can be achieved through fiscal policy incentives, a dynamic simulation modelling of the integrated energy-transport system with a detailed representation of energy technologies and vehicle fleets is implemented. The model is used for a scenario analysis by incorporating key fiscal parameters including different taxes and subsidies on vehicles and fuels. The fiscal policies to induce EVs, which are applied to both vehicle usage pattern and upfront purchase cost, include petroleum fuel tax levies, vehicle tax exemption, extra fees and subsidies. Five fiscal-induced scenarios to promote EVs, including different subsidy and feebate schemes coupled with fuel tax incentives, are compared with a BAU case. The scenario analysis reveals the impact of different fiscal policy incentives on consumer decision behaviour and the implications of fiscal-induced EV promotion for vehicle ownership costs, government tax revenues/expenditure, and overall economic benefits.

The analysis addressed both fuel cycle and vehicle manufacturing cycle for the following vehicle types: gasoline and diesel internal combustion engine vehicles (FCEVs), flex fuel vehicles, compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Gasoline ICEVs using current technology have C2G emissions of ~450 gCO2e/mi (grams of carbon dioxide equivalents per mile), while C2G emissions from HEVs, PHEVs, H2 FCEVs, and BEVs range from 300-350 gCO2e/mi. Future vehicle efficiency gains are expected to reduce emissions to ~350 gCO2/mi for ICEVs and ~250 gCO2e/mi for HEVs, PHEVs, FCEVs, and BEVs. Utilizing low-carbon fuel pathways yields GHG reductions more than double those achieved by vehicle efficiency gains alone. Levelized costs of driving (LCDs) are in the range $0.25-$1.00/mi depending on time frame and vehicle-fuel technology. In all cases, vehicle cost represents the major (60-90%) contribution to LCDs. Currently, HEV and PHEV petroleum-fueled vehicles provide the most attractive cost in terms of avoided carbon emissions, although they offer lower potential GHG reductions. The ranges of LCD and cost of avoided carbon are narrower for the future technology pathways, reflecting the expected economic competitiveness of these alternative vehicles and fuels.

It is expected that the deployment of future smart grids will allow two-way energy and information flows through plug-and-play operation of small distributed mobile power generators like electric vehicles (EVs) to benefit the prosumers and at the same time make the grid more efficient and robust. However, the issues associated with the energy and information transfer, battery technologies, battery charging schemes, their standards and management need to be addressed in order to achieve the full benefits of EV integration in the future smart grids and internet of energy (IoE) with local renewable generation. As the current grid with existing infrastructure cannot ensure maximum benefits from EVs, this paper reviews the EV technologies, their connectivity, impacts on grid and standards required for the efficient and economic operation of EVs with distributed energy resources in the IoE. The evolution, comparison, and storage potential of EV technologies are thoroughly discussed. This paper also extensively reviews the connectivity issues, for example current EV charging schemes, software tools required to design smart charging, associated challenges, and possible solutions. The architecture of distributed energy management schemes with EVs and the IoE is discussed in detail. Finally, the standards related to EV integration, energy transfers, and safety aspects are provided. Based on the comprehensive review, future directions are put forward which will be useful for researchers and engineers working with EVs.

The combination of electricity prices and Feed in Tariff schemes can either act as an enabler or a barrier to the economics of battery investment. At the moment, the investment in used batteries makes sense mostly in Germany but countries such as UK and Italy or Spain could be future candidates. In terms of energy policy adjustments, appropriate financial incentives are necessary to encourage the investment in such systems.

New sources of reserves can be found in distributed energy resources: controllable loads, Electric Vehicles (EVs), distributed generation units. However, it is necessary to adapt the frequency-regulation reserve market design to allow these new resources to participate through new market players known as aggregators. The aim of this paper is to provide a modular framework to analyze frequency regulation markets or mechanisms in order i) to identify barriers to entry for aggregators and ii) to identify some options to overcome these barriers. A case study of the situation in 2016 of four major European frequency regulation markets is performed to show how this framework could be used by aggregators or policy-makers.

Some are region-specific (e.g. availability of charging infrastructure) while others are global in nature (e.g. battery prices) where improvements spill over between regions. This study explores regional spillover effects and GHG impacts of strong ZEV-focused policy, specifically the ZEV mandate in place in ten U.S. states (ZEV States) which requires automakers to sell a minimum amount of ZEVs each year. We use a dynamic technology adoption model to simulate passenger vehicle sectors in North America, focusing on the case of one small region (British Columbia, covering 0.7% of the market) as potentially free-riding off of ZEV States policy (covering 23% of the market). Results indicate that free-ridership is not effective; even with the ZEV mandate driving very high sales in ZEV States, British Columbia cannot achieve significant ZEV adoption without also implementing its own ZEV mandate. Further, for British Columbia to meet its 2050 GHG targets, it may need a ZEV mandate in addition to complementary climate policiespushing ZEVs to account for 4093% of new vehicle sales in 2050. In short, regions seeking low-carbon transportation likely need to implement their own stringent policies.

Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is often used to assess and compare the environmental impacts of these technologies, but, in its traditional form, it lacks the ability to capture the transient effects as new vehicles displace older vehicles in the fleet. Fleet-based life-cycle (LC) approaches  which combine the LCA methodology with fleet models that describe the stocks and flows associated with a class of products over time  have been proposed to circumvent this issue. This article presents a critical review of the literature addressing fleet-based LC approaches by providing an overview of modeling approaches, its main applications, and an analysis of the key aspects underlying environmental and energy impacts of vehicle fleets (focusing on electrification pathways). Fleet-based LC approaches have been applied with different purposes (e.g., to model recycling processes, to assess trade-offs between manufacturing and use impacts; to optimize product service life). The issue of evaluating the impacts of introducing alternative technologies is appropriately addressed by a fleet-based LC approach, because it allows for the capture of displacement effects, technological improvements over time, and changes in background processes. Several studies have used such an approach to assess scenarios of evolution of the light-duty fleet. The main key aspects are: fleet penetration rate, electricity source, fuel economy improvements, and vehicle weight reduction. Emission reductions were found to be very dependent on the underlying assumptions. Reducing fuel consumption is one of the key ways to reduce fleet GHG emissions, but it needs to be combined with other measures, such as high penetration of advanced technologies, to bring about significant reductions. The electricity generation source has also a large impact on the fleet GHG emissions and increasing renewable energy penetration is key to reduce overall emissions.

VGI includes systems that treat plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) as controllable load with a unidirectional flow of electricity, such as &apos;smart&apos; or &apos;controlled&apos; charging or time-of-use (TOU) pricing. VGI typically encompasses vehicle-to-grid (V2G), a more technically advanced vision with bidirectional flow of electricity between the vehicle and power grid, in effect treating the PEV as a storage device. Such VGI systems could help decarbonize transportation, support load balancing, integrate renewable energy into the grid, increase revenues for electricity companies, and create new revenue streams for automobile owners. This review introduces various aspects and visions of VGI based on a comprehensive review. In doing so, it identifies the possible benefits, opportunities, and barriers relating to V2G, according to technical, financial, socio-environmental, and behavioral components. After summarizing our sociotechnical approach and the various opportunities and barriers indicated by existing literature, we construct a proposed research agenda to provide insights into previously understudied and unstudied research objectives. We find that the majority of VGI studies to date focus on technical aspects of VGI, notably on the potential of V2G systems to facilitate load balancing or to minimize electricity costs, in some cases including environmental goals as constraints. Only a few studies directly investigate the role of consumer acceptance and driver behavior within such systems, and barely any studies address the need for institutional capacity and cross-sectoral policy coordination. These gaps create promising opportunities for future research.

To understand this kind of decentralized refueling behavior, we surveyed 133 drivers of CNG fleet vehicles at six public stations across the Los Angeles region. Nearly one-third of CNG fleet drivers were solely reliant upon public refueling for their operations. For each driver&apos;s refueling trip, we used GIS to compare the chosen station&apos;s proximity to the driver&apos;s fleet base and their deviation from the shortest path between their previous and next stops relative to all other stations they could have chosen. This revealed-preference approach shows that fleet drivers chose the station with the smallest deviation over the station closest to base by a 6:1 ratio, though this ratio varied by the driver&apos;s availability of central refueling and type of vehicle and route. Given that public stations remain essential to meeting decentralized refueling demand for other fleets as well as consumers, these findings have important implications for fleets that are both considering the adoption of CNG vehicles and the additional investment of hosting central refueling infrastructure at their base.

The first four factors have apparent and positive impacts on the demands, and the last two factors dont. The gasoline price affects the demands for BEVs (battery electric vehicles) more than that for PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles). One percent increase in renewables would lead to approximately 26% increase in EV demands. Based on the results, policy implications are discussed.

With the transition; towards a sustainable energy system, the household load is changing, through the introduction of photovoltaics and electric vehicles. The tariff structures which are currently employed in the EU are either capacity and/or energy consumption based. In light of the changes in the household load the question whether these tariff structures are the most suitable merits renewed attention. In this work, the cost-reflectivity of various tariff structures has been computed based on a distribution network planning approach. Next to this, the predictability of a network tariff, i.e. how much change would a household experience in network charges in two consecutive years has also been computed to gain insight into how well users will be able to react to the tariff. The results show that a peak load based network tariffs score best on the reflectivity while having an acceptable level of predictability. The switch from an energy consumption based network tariff, which is now most often applied, towards a peak load based network tariff should therefore, be considered.

The adoption of PHEVs is associated with significant social, economic, environmental, and health benefits. However, most researchers in literature generally estimate emissions using national averages of emission data. The purpose of this paper is to address this gap. Specifically, we estimated CO 2 emissions of PHEVs using a life-cycle analysis in 8 Canadian cities (Vancouver, St John&apos;s, Charlottetown, Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Regina, and Calgary). We found that across Canada the varying electricity generation profiles affected the potential reduction benefit in life-cycle CO 2 emissions. For example, 95% of the energy in the province of Alberta was generated from fossil fuels, which emited a high amount of GHGs. Consequently, Calgary (city located in Alberta) had the highest CO 2 life-cycle emissions for PHEVs, where electricity generation accounted for 61% of the total emissions. Conversely, the provinces of British Columbia (BC) and Quebec (QC) used 86% and 98% clean energy, respectively. The cities evaluated in our analysis that are located in these provinces (i.e., Vancouver, BC and Montreal, QC) presented the lowest CO 2 emissions from electricity generation with less than 4% of the total PHEV emissions. Our study provides insight for policy makers about direct investment in EV incentives across Canada and where these incentives could be focused.

Daily BC exposures (24-h) were monitored using a micro-aethalometer micoAeth AE51 with forty school-aged children living in an urban area in Korea from August 2015 to January 2016. The children&apos;s time-activity patterns and the MEs they visited were investigated by means of a time-activity diary (TAD) and follow-up interviews with the children and their parents. Potential inhaled dose was estimated by multiplying the airborne BC concentrations (g/m 3 ) we monitored for the time the children spent in a particular ME by the inhalation rate (IR, m 3 /h) for the time-activity performed. The contribution of activities and MEs to overall daily exposure to and potential dose of BC was quantified. Overall mean daily potential dose was equal to 24.1 ± 10.6 g/day (range: 6.646.3 g/day). The largest contribution to BC exposure and potential dose (51.9% and 41.7% respectively) occurred in the home thanks to the large amount of time spent there. Transportation was where children received the most intense exposure to (14.8%) and potential dose (20.2%) of BC, while it accounted for 7.6% of daily time. School on weekdays during the semester was responsible for 20.3% of exposure and 22.5% of potential dose. Contribution to BC exposure and potential dose was altered by several time-activity parameters, such as type of day (weekdays vs. weekends; school days vs. holidays), season, and gender. Traveling by motor vehicle and subway showed more elevated exposure or potential dose intensity on weekdays or school days, probably influenced by the increased surrounding traffic volumes on these days compared to on weekends or holidays. This study may be used to prioritize targets for minimizing children&apos;s exposure to BC and to indicate outcomes of BC control strategies.

It is used in many studies on emission modeling such as the MOVES (Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator) model. The existing studies develop specific VSP distributions (or OpMode distribution in MOVES) for different road types and various average speeds to represent the vehicle operating modes on road. However, it is still not clear if the facility- and speed-specific VSP distributions are consistent temporally and spatially. For instance, is it necessary to update periodically the database of the VSP distributions in the emission model? Are the VSP distributions developed in the city central business district (CBD) area applicable to its suburb area? In this context, this study examined the temporal and spatial consistency of the facility- and speed-specific VSP distributions in Beijing. The VSP distributions in different years and in different areas are developed, based on real-world vehicle activity data. The root mean square error (RMSE) is employed to quantify the difference between the VSP distributions. The maximum differences of the VSP distributions between different years and between different areas are approximately 20% of that between different road types. The analysis of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission factor indicates that the temporal and spatial differences of the VSP distributions have no significant impact on vehicle emission estimation, with relative error of less than 3%. Implications: The temporal and spatial differences have no significant impact on the development of the facility- and speed-specific VSP distributions for the vehicle emission estimation. The database of the specific VSP distributions in the VSP-based emission models can maintain in terms of time. Thus, it is unnecessary to update the database regularly, and it is reliable to use the history vehicle activity data to forecast the emissions in the future. In one city, the areas with less data can still develop accurate VSP distributions based on better data from other areas.

This review emphasizes the basic types of electric vehicles (EVs), various factors affecting to increase the number of FEVs to use, the CO 2 emission and fuel economy, and a new charging mechanism for increasing the usage of FEVs. The EVs such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), the hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and the FEVs are recharged externally. The HEVs are the one will cover longer traveling distance compared to PHEVs and FEVs because of internal combustion engine. The PHEVs provides on-board charging and an option for sustaining mode of operation. On the other hand, FEVs run only with the help of batteries and the electricity required for recharging the batteries is generated from the conventional power plants which produces more greenhouse gas emission. In order to overcome this problem, a new recharging mechanism is proposed, which has both the renewable sources (wind and solar) moreover it automatically recharges the battery banks present in the FEVs. A wind duct is incorporated for increasing the velocity of the wind and the model of both the wind and the photovoltaic (PV) system have been studied. Furthermore, the streamline plot of wind duct is simulated at various values of Reynolds number and the PV array is modeled using Simscape. The performance and comparison results indicate that the proposed system can be used for charging the batteries of EVs.

A heavy emphasis is placed on stimulation of electric vehicles (EVs) to handle these problems associated with various complexities and uncertainties in municipal energy system (MES). In this study, an interval-possibilistic basic-flexible programming (IPBFP) method is proposed for planning MES of Qingdao, where uncertainties expressed as interval-flexible variables and interval-possibilistic parameters can be effectively reflected. Support vector regression (SVR) is used for predicting electricity demand of the city under various scenarios. Solutions of EVs stimulation levels and satisfaction levels in association with flexible constraints and predetermined necessity degrees are analyzed, which can help identify the optimized energy-supply patterns that could plunk for improvement of air quality and hedge against violation of soft constraints. Results disclose that largely developing EVs can help facilitate the city&apos;s energy system with an environment-effective way. However, compared to the rapid growth of transportation, the EVs&apos; contribution of improving the city&apos;s air quality is limited. It is desired that, to achieve an environmentally sustainable MES, more concerns should be focused on the integration of increasing renewable energy resources, stimulating EVs as well as improving energy transmission, transport and storage.

Based on this table, we estimate the effect of using renewable energy on Japan&apos;s economic structure as well as the feed-in tariff&apos;s contribution to the cost structure. The results clearly show that, induced by demand, existing power generation options and the production of existing passenger vehicles would be reduced and replaced by electric vehicles (EVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHVs), and the renewable energy sector. Furthermore, the demand for production in the supply chain of these sectors would change. While the feed-in tariff seems to benefit the overall Japanese economy, the benefits are not divided equally among the sectors because the positive effect of the feed-in tariff system is greater than the negative effect in energy and energy-intensive industries, while the negative effect is greater in the service sectors, on which the cost of the feed-in tariff system is levied. However, renewable-energy-induced service activities, such as research and business services, are becoming more pervasive. Therefore, this inequality may be resolved in the long term and could be assisted by policies that accelerate this change.

HEVs (hybrid electric vehicles) have proved a viable option to guaranteeing improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The fuel consumption benefits which can be realised when utilising HEV architecture are dependent on how much braking energy is regenerated, and how well the regenerated energy is utilised. The challenge in developing an HEV control strategy lies in the satisfaction of often conflicting control constraints involving fuel consumption, emissions and driveability, without over-depleting the battery state of charge at the end of the defined driving cycle. As a result, a number of power management strategies have been proposed in literature. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these literatures, focusing primarily on contributions in the aspect of parallel hybrid electric vehicle modelling and control. As part of this treatise, exploitable research gaps are also identified.

The Electrification Case assumes approximately 17% of light duty and 8% of heavy duty vehicle miles traveled and from 17% to 79. of various off-road equipment types considered good candidates for electrification is powered by electricity. The Electrification Case raises electricity demand by 5% over the 2030 Base Case but nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions decrease by 20. thousand tons (3%) overall. Emissions of other criteria pollutants also decrease. Air quality benefits of electrification are modest, mostly less than 1 ppb for ozone and 0.5 g m-3 for fine particulate matter (PM2.5), but widespread. The largest reductions for ozone and PM occur in urban areas due to lower mobile source emissions. Electrifying off-road equipment yields more benefits than electrifying on-road vehicles. Reduced crude oil imports and associated marine vessel emissions cause additional benefits in port cities. Changes in other gas and PM emissions, as well as impacts on acid and nutrient deposition, are discussed.

The current situation and future development trends of batteries are introduced. Graphene batteries have a higher specific energy, higher specific capacity and lower cost than conventional batteries. If nanographene technology enhances battery power and prolongs life span, it will have attractive prospects in the field of electric vehicles. This article summarizes the recent progress in graphene nano batteries regarding structural models, nanoscale effects and system design. It also proposes future directions for research on battery electric vehicle technology as well as the prospect of graphene battery applications.

The concept of EVs focuses on the utilization of alternative energy resources. However, EV systems currently face challenges in energy storage systems (ESSs) with regard to their safety, size, cost, and overall management issues. In addition, hybridization of ESSs with advanced power electronic technologies has a significant influence on optimal power utilization to lead advanced EV technologies. This paper comprehensively reviews technologies of ESSs, its classifications, characteristics, constructions, electricity conversion, and evaluation processes with advantages and disadvantages for EV applications. Moreover, this paper discusses various classifications of ESS according to their energy formations, composition materials, and techniques on average power delivery over its capacity and overall efficiencies exhibited within their life expectancies. The rigorous review indicates that existing technologies for ESS can be used for EVs, but the optimum use of ESSs for efficient EV energy storage applications has not yet been achieved. This review highlights many factors, challenges, and problems for sustainable development of ESS technologies in next-generation EV applications. Thus, this review will widen the effort toward the development of economic and efficient ESSs with a longer lifetime for future EV uses.

Currently, there is little urban LDSA data. As a case study, we investigated measurements of LDSA (alveolar) concentrations in a mid-size European city. LDSA and associated measurements were carried out over 1.5 years at an urban background site in Leicester, UK. Average LDSA concentrations in the cold (NovemberApril) and warm (MayOctober) seasons of UK were 37 and 23 m 2 cm 3 , respectively. LDSA correlates well (R 2 = 0.650.7, r = 0.770.8) with traffic related pollutants, such as equivalent black carbon (eBC) and NO X . We also report for the first time in the UK the correlation between an empirically derived LDSA and eBC. Furthermore, the effect of wind speed and direction on the LDSA was explored. Higher LDSA concentrations are observed at low wind speeds (12 m s 1 ), owing to local traffic emissions. In addition, the diurnal variation of LDSA showed a second peak in the afternoon under warm and relatively clean atmospheric conditions, which can be attributed to photochemical new particle formation (NPF) and growth into the Aitken mode range. These NPF events increased the average background LDSA concentrations from 15.5 to 35.5 m 2 cm 3 , although they might not be health-relevant. Overall, the results support the notion that local traffic emissions are a major contributor to observed LDSA concentrations with a clear seasonal pattern with higher values during winter.

PIARC emission factors are conservative and exhibit the largest prediction errors, except for one very good agreement for LDV NO x . COPERT Australia is generally accurate at fleet level for CO, NO x , PM 2.5 and PM 10 , when compared with other international studies, and consistently underestimates emissions by 7%37%, depending on the pollutant. Possible contributing factors are under-representation of high/excessive emitting vehicles, inaccurate mileage correction factors, and lack of empirical emissions data for Australian diesel cars. The study results demonstrate a large uncertainty in speciated VOC and PAH emission factors.

However, the different changing patterns in emissions at upstream and on-road stages and complex atmospheric chemistry of pollutants lead to uncertainty in the air quality benefits from fleet electrification. This study considers the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region in China to investigate whether EVs can improve future air quality. The Community Multiscale Air Quality model enhanced by the two-dimensional volatility basis set module is applied to simulate the temporally, spatially, and chemically resolved changes in PM2.5 concentrations and the changes of other pollutants from fleet electrification. A probable scenario (Scenario EV1) with 20% of private light-duty passenger vehicles and 80% of commercial passenger vehicles (e.g., taxis and buses) electrified can reduce average PM2.5 concentrations by 0.4 to 1.1 1/4g m-3 during four representative months for all urban areas of YRD in 2030. The seasonal distinctions of the air quality impacts with respect to concentration reductions in key aerosol components are also identified. For example, the PM2.5 reduction in January is mainly attributed to the nitrate reduction, whereas the secondary organic aerosol reduction is another essential contributor in August. EVs can also effectively assist in mitigating NO2 concentrations, which would gain greater reductions for traffic-dense urban areas (e.g., Shanghai). This paper reveals that the fleet electrification in the YRD region could generally play a positive role in improving regional and urban air quality.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the association between exposure to air pollution from road traffic and the risk of ASD in children, with careful adjustment for socioeconomic and other confounders. METHOD: Children born and residing in Stockholm, Sweden, during 1993-2007 with an ASD diagnosis were identified through multiple health registers and classified as cases (n = 5,136). A randomly selected sample of 18,237 children from the same study base constituted controls. Levels of nitrogen oxides (NOX) and particulate matter with diameter  10 m (PM10) from road traffic were estimated at residential addresses during mother&apos;s pregnancy and the child&apos;s first year of life by dispersion models. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ASD with or without intellectual disability (ID) were estimated using logistic regression models after conditioning on municipality and calendar year of birth as well as adjustment for potential confounders. RESULT: Air pollution exposure during the prenatal period was not associated with ASD overall (OR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.15 per 10-g/m3 increase in PM10 and OR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.10 per 20-g/m3 increase in NOX during mother&apos;s pregnancy). Similar results were seen for exposure during the first year of life, and for ASD in combination with ID. An inverse association between air pollution exposure and ASD risk was observed among children of mothers who moved to a new residence during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Early-life exposure to low levels of NOX and PM10 from road traffic does not appear to increase the risk of ASD.

The primary air pollutants emitted by motor vehicles are CO, NO and PM. Various investigations identify key health outcomes to be consistently associated with NO and CO. The objective of this study was the measurement-based assessment for determining whether by high-traffic roads, such as motorways and express ways, and the concentrations of CO and NO are within normal limits and do not pose threat to the local population. Average daily values (arithmetic values calculated for 1-h values within 24 h or less, depending on result availability) were measured for concentrations of NO and CO by automatic stations belonging to the Voivodship Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Katowice, in areas with similar dominant source of pollutant emission. The measurements were made in three sites: near the motorway and expressway, where the average daily traffic intensity is 100983 and 35414 of vehicles relatively. No evidence was found of exceeding average daily values equal to the maximum allowable NO concentration due to the protection of human health in the measurement area of the stations. No daily average values exceeding the admissible CO concentration (8-h moving average) were noted in the examined period. The results clearly show lack of hazards for general population health in terms of increased concentrations of CO and NO compounds that are closely related to high intensity car traffic found on selected motorways and speedways located near the city centres.

China has established integrated emission control policies and measures since the 1990s, including implementation of emission standards for new vehicles, inspection and maintenance programs for in-use vehicles, improvement in fuel quality, promotion of sustainable transportation and alternative fuel vehicles, and traffic management programs. As a result, emissions of major air pollutants from on-road vehicles in China have peaked and are now declining despite increasing vehicle population. As might be expected, progress in addressing vehicle emissions has not always been smooth and challenges such as the lack of low sulfur fuels, frauds over production conformity and in-use inspection tests, and unreliable retrofit programs have been encountered. Considering the high emission density from vehicles in East China, enhanced vehicle, fuel and transportation strategies will be required to address vehicle emissions in China. We project the total vehicle population in China to reach 400500 million by 2030. Serious air pollution problems in many cities of China, in particular high ambient PM 2.5 concentration, have led to pressure to accelerate the progress on vehicle emission reduction. A notable example is the draft China 6 emission standard released in May 2016, which contains more stringent emission limits than those in the Euro 6 regulations, and adds a real world emission testing protocol and a 48-h evaporation testing procedure including diurnal and hot soak emissions. A scenario ( PC[1] ) considered in this study suggests that increasingly stringent standards for vehicle emissions could mitigate total vehicle emissions of HC, CO, NO X and PM 2.5 in 2030 by approximately 39%, 57%, 59% and 79%, respectively, compared with 2013 levels. With additional actions to control the future light-duty passenger vehicle population growth and use, and introduce alternative fuels and new energy vehicles, the China total vehicle emissions of HC, CO, NO X and PM 2.5 in 2030 could be reduced by approximately 57%, 71%, 67% and 84%, respectively, (the PC[2] scenario) relative to 2013. This paper provides detailed policy roadmaps and technical options related to these future emission reductions for governmental stakeholders.

Incorporating renewable energy sources (RESs) and storage devices into MG could play a vital role in enhancing the reliability of the system. However, due to the intermittent nature of RESs, voltage fluctuations may occur in the system. Therefore, storage devices can be the most viable option to handle the intermittent issues of RESs. Nowadays, handling a group of batteries with different ratings in the MG has been a major focus of research. The batteries with different ratings used for storage as well as grid support is termed as a distributed energy storage system. This work mainly emphasises on optimal power management of an MG by controlling the charging and discharging rates of individual battery. A droop-based controller is proposed for optimal power management of batteries. An aggregator has been suggested at the MG which distributes the power among the various charging stations (CSs) and each CS finally distributes the power among the individual batteries based on droop participation factor. Moreover, the charging and discharging rates of batteries are controlled to achieve the desired power flow between the MG and CSs. The simulation results show the efficacy of the controller to meet the desired power at the MG. The proposed system is compared with an existing system to prove the efficacy of the proposed controller. Moreover, all the critical cases have been considered, such as the sudden failure of any generating unit. It has been observed that due to sudden failure of any generating unit, CSs manages power of the MG by altering charging and discharging rate of the batteries.

Considering automakers&apos; long history of opposition to environmental regulations in the US, Obama&apos;s achievement poses an intriguing research puzzle: how was the US able to enact environmental policy regarding the automotive industry? This article considers conventional explanations of policy adoption but also examines whether globalization, including compliance with global regulations, as well as global competition that left US manufacturers in a weakened economic and political state, influenced firms to acquiesce to environmental regulation. This article finds that globalization concerns motivated nearly all firms to acquiesce to the new policies. Policy enactment was facilitated by conditions within the industry, including global competition and production, technological developments, compliance with carbon and fuel economy regulations across the globe, and the financial and political weakness of domestic firms. Conventional explanations also help to explain policy enactment. Where executive authority existed, President Obama enacted policy via the executive branch rather than working with Congress. Policies created by the passage of legislation in Congress were shaped by presidential leadership, partisan control and outside events. Finally, policymakers built coalitions of support among domestic automakers, labor, environmental and consumer groups, and the public.

The aim of this article is to implement a decision-making model for public administration which can select the best innovation policies based on a number of criteria reflecting their major goals in terms of policies relating to energy, economics, social cohesion and factor 4 (to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a factor of 4 by 2050 compared with 1990 levels). The methodology developed herein has been applied to a concrete case, with some resulting recommendations which may be of use for the public authorities: simultaneously combine research in favour of solar mobility technologies and apply a relatively high carbon tax. Such recommendations are mitigated by the choice of the data set and the methodological shortcomings.

As a result, emissions from motor vehicles have been found as one main source of air pollution in China, which consequently influences the residents&apos; health. To better understand the environmental deterioration and health losses caused by the transport sector in China, in current circumstances, one must know how the changes in residents&apos; travel demand and alternative transport modes affect environment and health co-benefits in China. We first of all calculate the demand from nearly all the residents&apos; travel means, including road, rail, water, and air transport. Besides, based on the results, this paper further makes projections for a business-as-usual scenario for 2050 with several alternative transport scenarios to reduce harmful emissions and improve the welfare of the residents&apos; health in China. Our integrated framework includes the harmful emissions models, the fixed box model and the exposure-response models, to link transport demand with possible environmental and health outcomes. The findings suggest that significant environment and health co-benefits are possible if alternative transport replaces. This research, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to estimate the total resident&apos;s travel demand under different scenarios and the consequent environment and health co-benefits in the transitional China.

With full EV penetration (i.e., the replacement of all light-duty vehicles), CO, VOCs, NO x and PM 2.5 emissions in Taiwan from a fleet of 20.6 million vehicles would be reduced by 1500, 165, 33.9 and 7.2 Gg yr  1 , respectively, while electric sector NO x and SO 2 emissions would be increased by up to 20.3 and 12.9 Gg yr  1 , respectively, if the electricity to power EVs were provided by thermal power plants. The net impacts of these emission changes would be to reduce the annual mean surface concentrations of CO, VOCs, NO x and PM 2.5 by about 260, 11.3, 3.3 ppb and 2.1 g m  3 , respectively, but to increase SO 2 by 0.1 ppb. Larger reductions tend to occur at time and place of higher ambient concentrations and during high pollution events. Greater benefits would clearly be attained if clean energy sources were fully encouraged. EV penetration would also reduce the mean peak-time surface O 3 concentrations by up to 7 ppb across Taiwan with the exception of the center of metropolitan Taipei where the concentration increased by &lt; 2 ppb. Furthermore, full EV penetration would reduce annual days of O 3 pollution episodes by ~ 40% and PM 2.5 pollution episodes by 610%. Our findings offer important insights into the air quality impacts of EV and can provide useful information for potential mitigation actions.

Recharging time and driving range are amongst the biggest hurdles for the mainstream acceptance and implementation of EV technology. Fast-DC charging significantly reduces the recharging time and can be used to make longer EV trips possible, e.g. on highways between cities. Although some EV and hybrid car studies have been conducted that address separately issues such as limited drivable ranges, charge stations, impact from auxiliary loads on vehicle energy consumption and emissions, there is currently limited research on the impact on drivable range from the combination of driving EVs at highway speeds, using auxiliary loads such as heating or air conditioning (AC), and reduced charge capacity from fast-DC charging and discharge safety margins. In this study we investigate these parameters and their impact on energy consumption and drivable range of EVs. Our results show a significantly reduced range under conditions relevant for highway driving and significant deviation from driving ranges published by EV manufacturers. The results and outcomes of this project are critical for the efficient design and implementation of so-called Electric Highways. To prevent stranded cars and a possible negative perception of EVs, drivers and charging infrastructure planners need be aware of how EV energy and recharging demands can significantly change under different loads and driving patterns.

Currently, no consensus exists on appropriate methods for quantifying emissions from particular electricity loads. This paper reviews a wide range of the existing methods, detailing their functionality, tractability, and appropriate use. We identified and reviewed 32 methods and models and classified them into two distinct categories: empirical data and relationship models and power system optimization models. To illustrate the impact of method selection, we calculate the CO2 combustion emissions factors associated with electric-vehicle charging using 10 methods at nine charging station locations around the United States. Across the methods, we found an up to 68% difference from the mean CO2 emissions factor for a given charging site among both marginal and average emissions factors and up to a 63% difference from the average across average emissions factors. Our results underscore the importance of method selection and the need for a consensus on approaches appropriate for particular loads and research questions being addressed in order to achieve results that are more consistent across studies and allow for soundly supported policy decisions. The paper addresses this issue by offering a set of recommendations for determining an appropriate model type on the basis of the load characteristics and study objectives.

Hence, evaluation of their emissions becomes very important in order to be able to anticipate their impact and share in the total emissions from the transport sector. For that reason the emissions from a Euro 5 compliant hybrid electric vehicle (HV2) and a Euro 5 plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHV1) were investigated with special interest on exhaust emissions of ammonia, acetaldehyde and ethanol. Vehicles were tested over the World harmonized Light-duty Test Cycle (WLTC) at 23 and 7 °C using two different commercial fuels E5 and E10 (gasoline containing 5% and 10% vol/vol of ethanol, respectively). PHV1 resulted in lower emissions than HV2 due to the pure electric strategy used by the former. PHV1 and HV2 showed lower regulated emissions than conventional Euro 5 gasoline light duty vehicles. However, emissions of ammonia (28 and 615 mg km 1 at 22 and 7 °C, respectively), ethanol (0.30.8 and 2.67.2 mg km 1 at 22 and 7 °C, respectively) and acetaldehyde (0.2 and 0.82.7 mg km 1 at 22 and 7 °C, respectively) were in the same range of those recently reported for conventional gasoline light duty vehicles.

Therefore, governments have been heavily incentivising the market to switch to electric passenger cars in order to reduce air pollution. However, this literature review suggests that electric vehicles may not reduce levels of PM as much as expected, because of their relatively high weight. By analysing the existing literature on non-exhaust emissions of different vehicle categories, this review found that there is a positive relationship between weight and non-exhaust PM emission factors. In addition, electric vehicles (EVs) were found to be 24% heavier than equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). As a result, total PM 10 emissions from EVs were found to be equal to those of modern ICEVs. PM 2.5 emissions were only 13% lower for EVs compared to modern ICEVs. Therefore, it could be concluded that the increased popularity of electric vehicles will likely not have a great effect on PM levels. Non-exhaust emissions already account for over 90% of PM 10 and 85% of PM 2.5 emissions from traffic. These proportions will continue to increase as exhaust standards improve and average vehicle weight increases. Future policy should consequently focus on setting standards for non-exhaust emissions and encouraging weight reduction of all vehicles to significantly reduce PM emissions from traffic.

A number of measures have been introduced in these countries in order to reduce road dust emissions. These include speed reductions, reductions in studded tyre use, dust binding and road cleaning. Implementation of such measures can be costly and some confidence in the impact of the measures is required to weigh the costs against the benefits. Modelling tools are thus required that can predict the impact of these measures. In this paper the NORTRIP road dust emission model is used to simulate real world abatement measures that have been carried out in Oslo and Stockholm. In Oslo both vehicle speed and studded tyre share reductions occurred over a period from 2004 to 2006 on a major arterial road, RV4. In Stockholm a studded tyre ban on Hornsgatan in 2010 saw a significant reduction in studded tyre share together with a reduction in traffic volume. The model is found to correctly simulate the impact of these measures on the PM 10 concentrations when compared to available kerbside measurement data. Importantly meteorology can have a significant impact on the concentrations through both surface and dispersion conditions. The first year after the implementation of the speed reduction on RV4 was much drier than the previous year, resulting in higher mean concentrations than expected. The following year was much wetter with significant rain and snow fall leading to wet or frozen road surfaces for 83% of the four month study period. This significantly reduced the net PM 10 concentrations, by 58%, compared to the expected values if meteorological conditions had been similar to the previous years. In the years following the studded tyre ban on Hornsgatan road wear production through studded tyres decreased by 72%, due to a combination of reduced traffic volume and reduced studded tyre share. However, after accounting for exhaust contributions and the impact of meteorological conditions in the model calculations then the net mean reduction in PM 10 concentrations was only 50%, in agreement with observations. The NORTRIP model is shown to be able to reproduce the impacts of both traffic measures and meteorology on traffic induced PM 10 concentrations, making it a unique and valuable tool for predicting the impact of measures for air quality management applications.

From another perspective, because significant societal problems arise from the use of traditional energy sources such as fossil and nuclear fuels, employing optimized electricity generation systems powered by renewable energy resources is a potential pathway for sustainability while simultaneously minimizing any associated negative environmental effects. Consequently, Daejeon metropolitan city, South Korea, is attempting to introduce electric vehicles (EVs) for local taxis and establish renewable power generation systems. Therefore, the current study explores the use of potential renewable electricity generation systems by local taxi services in Daejeon. Using HOMER (Hybrid Renewable and Distributed Generation System Design) software, systems using solar energy, wind energy, batteries, converters, and the electrical grid are proposed for the third stage of the adoption of electric-powered taxis (EP taxis) in Daejeon. An economic assessment is conducted for renewable electricity generation systems, including the cost of energy (COE) and renewable fractions. Based on the simulations results, the potential system shows a renewable fraction of 0.82 and a COE of 0.425 $/kWh for the most reliable case (with grid connection), 0.79 and 0.180 $/kWh for the most optimal case (with grid connection), and 1.00 and 0.461 $/kWh for the most optimal independent case, respectively.

Optimising neighbourhood walkability is desirable in built environments, however, the population health benefits of walkability may be offset by increased exposure to traffic related air pollution. This paper describes the spatial distribution of neighbourhood walkability and weighted road density, a marker for traffic related air pollution, in Sydney, Australia. As exposure to air pollution is related to socio-economic status in some cities, this paper also examines the spatial distribution of weighted road density and walkability by socio-economic status (SES).&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;We calculated walkability, weighted road density (as a measure of traffic related air pollution) and SES, using predefined and validated measures, for 5858 Sydney neighbourhoods, representing 3.6 million population. We overlaid tertiles of walkability and weighted road density to define &quot;sweet-spots&quot; (high walkability-low weighted road density), and &quot;sour- spots&quot; (low walkability-high weighted road density) neighbourhoods. We also examined the distribution of walkability and weighted road density by SES quintiles.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;Walkability and weighted road density showed a clear east-west gradient across the region. Our study found that only 4 % of Sydney&apos;s population lived in sweet-spot&quot; neighbourhoods with high walkability and low weighted road density (desirable), and these tended to be located closer to the city centre. A greater proportion of neighbourhoods had health limiting attributes of high weighted road density or low walkability (about 20 % each), and over 5 % of the population lived in &quot;sour-spot&quot; neighbourhoods with low walkability and high weighted road density (least desirable). These neighbourhoods were more distant from the city centre and scattered more widely. There were no linear trends between walkability/weighted road density and neighbourhood SES.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/bold&gt;Our walkability and weighted road density maps and associated analyses by SES can help identify neighbourhoods with inequalities in health-promoting or health-limiting environments. Planning agencies should seek out opportunities for increased neighbourhood walkability through improved urban development and transport planning, which simultaneously minimizes exposure to traffic related air pollution.

RESULTS: Out of 1,806 participants at baseline, 191 were diagnosed with Alzheimer&apos;s disease during follow-up, and 111 were diagnosed with vascular dementia. Participants in the group with the highest exposure were more likely than those in the group with the lowest exposure to be diagnosed with dementia (Alzheimer&apos;s disease or vascular dementia), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.43 (95% CI: 0.998, 2.05 for the highest vs. the lowest quartile). The estimates were similar for Alzheimer&apos;s disease (HR 1.38) and vascular dementia (HR 1.47). The HR for dementia associated with the third quartile versus the lowest quartile was 1.48 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.11). A subanalysis that excluded a younger sample that had been retested after only 5 years of follow-up suggested stronger associations with exposure than were present in the full cohort (HR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.73 for the highest vs. the lowest quartile). CONCLUSIONS: If the associations we observed are causal, then air pollution from traffic might be an important risk factor for vascular dementia and Alzheimer&apos;s disease.

Potential modes of action are through stress and sleep disturbance, which may lead to endocrine dysregulation and overweight. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the relationship between residential traffic and railway noise and adiposity. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of 57,053 middle-aged people, height, weight, waist circumference, and bioelectrical impedance were measured at enrollment (1993--1997). Body mass index (BMI), body fat mass index (BFMI), and lean body mass index (LBMI) were calculated. Residential exposure to road and railway traffic noise exposure was calculated using the Nordic prediction method. Associations between traffic noise and anthropometric measures at enrollment were analyzed using general linear models and logistic regression adjusted for demographic and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: Linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, and socioeconomic factors showed that 5-year mean road traffic noise exposure preceding enrollment was associated with a 0.35-cm wider waist circumference (95% CI: 0.21, 0.50) and a 0.18-point higher BMI (95% CI: 0.12, 0.23) per 10 dB. Small, significant increases were also found for BFMI and LBMI. All associations followed linear exposure--response relationships. Exposure to railway noise was not linearly associated with adiposity measures. However, exposure &gt; 60 dB was associated with a 0.71-cm wider waist circumference (95% CI: 0.23, 1.19) and a 0.19-point higher BMI (95% CI: 0.0072, 0.37) compared with unexposed participants (0--20 dB).

OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigated long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and Parkinson&apos;s disease. METHODS: In a case-control study of 1,696 Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD) patients identified from Danish hospital registries and diagnosed 1996--2009 and 1,800 population controls matched by sex and year of birth, we assessed long-term traffic-related air pollutant exposures (represented by nitrogen dioxide; NO2) from a dispersion model, using residential addresses from 1971 to the date of diagnosis or first cardinal symptom for cases and the corresponding index date for their matched controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with logistic regression, adjusting for matching factors and potential confounders. RESULTS: We found ambient air pollution from traffic sources to be associated with risk of PD, with a 9% higher risk (95% CI: 3, 16.0%) per interquartile range increase (2.97 µg/m³) in modeled NO2. For participants living for  20 years in the capital city, ORs were larger (OR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.31) than in provincial towns (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.26), whereas there was no association among rural residents. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings raise concerns about potential effects of air pollution from traffic and other sources on the risk of PD, particularly in populations with high or increasing exposures.

Uncertainties associated with the production of these resources require higher amount of reserve to ensure system security and reliability. On the other hand, by development and deployment of electric vehicles in the near future, it is expected that large fleets of electric vehicles will constitute a significant share of electricity demand. These vehicles are equipped with rechargeable and dischargeable batteries that enable them to provide ancillary services by coordination with the system operator and their participation in energy and reserve markets. In this paper, a market clearing model, which also quantifies optimal spinning reserve, at the presence of wind power and participation of electric vehicles in the energy and reserve markets is proposed. Test results for the IEEE-Reliability Test System (RTS) illustrate that electric vehicles participation in these markets can counterbalance the adverse effects of increasing power demand because of their charging while being able to manage renewable resources uncertainties and hence improve system reliability.

In order to gauge the implications of the anticipated paradigm shift for the electricity system, new reference architectures and assessment methodologies shall be developed to properly capture the interactions between the different actors (especially utilities, operators, energy aggregators, end-users, etc.) and technologies to value and allocate the costs and benefits of such transformation. Against this background, this paper proposes a conceptual architecture and an assessment framework to explore how high penetration scenarios of electric vehicles and intermittent renewable generation can complement each other in emerging distribution networks. We start from the identification of the smart grid functionalities to be implemented in a system with distributed power injections under the need to supervise and coordinate myriads of decentralized and interoperable energy sources and actors. Relying upon the proposed smart grid conceptual architecture, we develop an assessment framework to maximize the renewable electricity and electric vehicle penetration for given electricity and transport systems. The application of the proposed assessment framework to a realistic case study, representing the distribution and mobility systems of a typical mid-size Italian city, illustrates how some of the limitations and constraints of the current electricity network operation and design approaches can be addressed and overcome. We show how integration of substantial amounts of energy production and electric-based transport technologies can be achieved while improving the reliability and sustainability performances of the emerging power systems.

The buses represented different technologies from the viewpoint of engines, exhaust after-treatment systems (ATS) and fuels. Some of the EEV buses were fueled by diesel, diesel-electric, ethanol (RED95) and compressed natural gas (CNG). At the depot area the emission factors were in the range of 0.3-21 × 1014 # (kg fuel)-1, 6-40 g (kg fuel)-1, 0.004-0.88 g (kg fuel)-1, 0.004-0.56 g (kg fuel)-1, 0.01-1.2 g (kg fuel)-1, for particle number (EFN), nitrogen oxides (EFNOx), black carbon (EFBC), organics (EFOrg), and particle mass (EFPM1), respectively. The highest particulate emissions were observed from the Euro III and Euro IV buses and the lowest from the ethanol and CNG-fueled buses, which emitted BC only during acceleration. The organics emitted from the CNG-fueled buses were clearly less oxidized compared to the other bus types. The bus line experiments showed that lowest emissions were obtained from the ethanol-fueled buses whereas large variation existed between individual buses of the same type indicating that the operating conditions by drivers had large effect on the emissions.

The increasing use of renewable energy sources makes this problem even more acute. Various existing technologies, including stationary battery energy storage systems (BESS), can be employed to provide additional power during peak demand times. In the future, integration of on-board batteries of the growing fleet of electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) into the grid can provide power during peak demand hours (vehicle-to-grid, or V2G technology). This work provides cost estimates of managing peak energy demands using traditional technologies, such as maneuverable power plants, conventional hydroelectric, pumped storage plants and peaker generators, as well as BESS and V2G technologies. The derived estimates provide both per kWh and kW year of energy supplied to the grid. The analysis demonstrates that the use of battery storage is economically justified for short peak demand periods of &lt;1 h. For longer durations, the most suitable technology remains the use of maneuverable steam gas power plants, gas turbine,reciprocating gas engine peaker generators, conventional hydroelectric, pumped storage plants.

However, the association between PAHs and breast cancer in women is unclear. Vehicular traffic is a major ambient source of PAH exposure. OBJECTIVES: Our study aim was to evaluate the association between residential exposure to vehicular traffic and breast cancer incidence. METHODS: Residential histories of 1,508 participants with breast cancer (case participants) and 1,556 particpants with no breast cancer (control participants) were assessed in a population-based investigation conducted in 1996-1997. Traffic exposure estimates of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), as a proxy for traffic-related PAHs, for the years 1960-1995 were reconstructed using a model previously shown to generate estimates consistent with measured soil PAHs, PAH-DNA adducts, and CO readings. Associations between vehicular traffic exposure estimates and breast cancer incidence were evaluated using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The odds ratio (95% CI) was modestly elevated by 1.44 (0.78, 2.68) for the association between breast cancer and long-term 1960-1990 vehicular traffic estimates in the top 5%, compared with below the median. The association with recent 1995 traffic exposure was elevated by 1.14 (0.80, 1.64) for the top 5%, compared with below the median, which was stronger among women with low fruit/vegetable intake [1.46 (0.89, 2.40)], but not among those with high fruit/vegetable intake [0.92 (0.53, 1.60)]. Among the subset of women with information regarding traffic exposure and tumor hormone receptor subtype, the traffic--breast cancer association was higher for those with estrogen/progesterone-negative tumors [1.67 (0.91, 3.05) relative to control participants], but lower among all other tumor subtypes [0.80 (0.50, 1.27) compared with control participants]. CONCLUSIONS: In our population-based study, we observed positive associations between vehicular traffic-related B[a]P exposure and breast cancer incidence among women with comparatively high long-term traffic B[a]P exposures, although effect estimates were imprecise.

Emissions can be greatly reduced by the total replacement of petroleum-based vehicles with electric vehicles using a combination of hydrogen and battery energy storage technologies. This paper analytically reviews the potential reduction in Australian road transport GHG emissions through the total replacement of petroleum-fueled vehicles with hydrogen and battery electrical vehicles by 2050. If electricity for hydrogen production &amp; storage and battery charging is sourced from the national electricity grid, it is estimated that emissions can be reduced by between 56% and 73% in 2050 compared to the Australian Governments Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE) projections, depending on the current range of government carbon price projections. Emissions can be reduced even further by supplementing grid electricity with standalone renewable electricity dedicated to hydrogen production and storage. It is found that there is more than sufficient renewable energy resources within Australia (particularly solar and wind) to meet the significant increase in the annual electricity generation that would be required to implement this strategy.

These active innovations have resulted in a large amount of spent lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) in China. At least two problems are declining the sustainability of production and final disposal of LiBs: one is potential environmental and health risk, and the other is that more and more valuable resources are being stored in spent LiBs without appropriate recycling. We found that a lack of effective regulation, collection systems and recycling technologies are major barriers and challenges to solve the problems. And in order to develop a comprehensive management scheme for this waste stream in China, we proposed a three-pronged approach: (1) new regulation or policy is quite a necessity to deal with the challenges unique to spent LiBs recycling; (2) collection systems for CE and EV batteries can be substantially established based upon past experience of general e-waste management and extended producer responsibility, respectively; and (3) more emphasis needs to be placed on new technology for spent LiBs recycling, to tackle the large quantities of stored spent LiBs.

If the tail pipe point emissions could be managed centrally without reducing the commercial and personal user functionalities, then one of the most attractive solutions for achieving a significant reduction of emissions in the transport sector would be the mass deployment of electric vehicles. Though electric vehicle sales are still hindered by battery performance, cost and a few other technological bottlenecks, focused commercialisation and support from government policies are encouraging large scale electric vehicle adoptions. The mass proliferation of plug-in electric vehicles is likely to bring a significant additional electric load onto the grid creating a highly complex operational problem for power system operators. Electric vehicle batteries also have the ability to act as energy storage points on the distribution system. This double charge and storage impact of many uncontrollable small kW loads, as consumers will want maximum flexibility, on a distribution system which was originally not designed for such operations has the potential to be detrimental to grid balancing. Intelligent scheduling methods if established correctly could smoothly integrate electric vehicles onto the grid. Intelligent scheduling methods will help to avoid cycling of large combustion plants, using expensive fossil fuel peaking plant, match renewable generation to electric vehicle charging and not overload the distribution system causing a reduction in power quality. In this paper, a state-of-the-art review of scheduling methods to integrate plug-in electric vehicles are reviewed, examined and categorised based on their computational techniques. Thus, in addition to various existing approaches covering analytical scheduling, conventional optimisation methods (e.g. linear, non-linear mixed integer programming and dynamic programming), and game theory, meta-heuristic algorithms including genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimisation, are all comprehensively surveyed, offering a systematic reference for grid scheduling considering intelligent electric vehicle integration.

An important issue is that high penetration of EVs brings heavy electricity demand to the power grid. One effective way to alleviate the impact is to integrate local power generation such as renewable energy sources (RESs) into charging infrastructure. Because of the intermittent and indispatchable nature of RESs, it becomes very challenging to coordinate EVs charging with other grid load and renewable generation. In this paper, EVs charging problem in the presence of smart grid technologies is investigated, and the interaction with renewable energy is reviewed. An overview about EVs and RESs is first presented, which mainly introduces major types of EVs and renewable energy estimation methods. Then, according to the objectives, the existing research works are divided into three categories: cost-aware, efficiency-aware, and emissions-aware interactions between EVs and RESs. Each categorys discussion includes the description of core ideas, summarization of solutions, and comparison between different works. Finally, some key open issues about EVs interacting with RESs are given and some possible solutions are also discussed.

Tier 2 emission standards are shown to be effective in lowering NOx, CO, and HC emission rates. Although PTs are larger, heavier vehicles that consume more fuel and produce more CO2 emissions, they do not necessarily produce more emissions of regulated pollutants compared to PCs. HEVs have very low emission rates compared to tier 2 vehicles under real-world driving. Emission factors vary with cycle average speed and road type, reflecting the combined impact of traffic control and traffic congestion. Compared to the slowest average speed and most congested cycles, optimal emission rates could be 50% lower for CO2, as much as 70% lower for NOx, 40% lower for CO, and 50% lower for HC. There is very high correlation among vehicles when comparing driving cycles. This has implications for how many cycles are needed to conduct comparisons between vehicles, such as when comparing fuels or technologies. Concordance between empirical and predicted emission rates using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&apos;s MOVES model was also assessed.

One problem about these volatility profiles is that they are evaluated only at one temperature which is usually 298 K. This study uses a simple statistical model to evaluate the temperature dependence of the source-resolved volatility basis set, considering gasoline and diesel vehicle exhaust. The steps involved (a) fitting a distribution to the emissions data (b) evaluating the goodness of fit using a statistical test (c) updating the volatility bins using the ClausiusClayperon equation; calculating the heats of vaporization of each volatility class using a regression model (d) assessing how the volatility of different VOC classes-Extremely Low Volatile, Low Volatile, Semi-Volatile, Intermediate Volatile and Volatile Organic Compounds  are affected by temperature. The results indicated that there could be significant changes in gas-particle partitioning of these emissions. For diesel exhaust at 298 K, the fractions are 5.4 × 10 4 (ELVOC), 0.074 (LVOC), 0.76 (SVOC), 0.17 (IVOC) and 10 5 (VOC) respectively. Looking at a window of 20 K, the partitioning for 278 K is 3 × 10 3 (ELVOC), 0.26 (LVOC), 0.67 (SVOC), 0.07 (IVOC) with no VOC fraction; while at 318 K it is 1.5 × 10 7 (ELVOC), 9 × 10 3 (LVOC), 0.64 (SVOC), 0.35 (IVOC) and 2 × 10 5 (VOC); demonstrating a significant change with temperature. The parameterizations developed in this work could be used to improve motor vehicle emissions inventory models such as MOVES.

The first two margins have been studied extensively, however the third has received scant attention. How significant is this intensive margin? What would be the optimal policies when it is taken into account? The paper develops and analyzes a simple model of the technical and behavioral mechanisms that determine the volume emissions produced by a car. The results show that an optimal fuel tax would provide drivers with appropriate incentives along all three margins and that only public information is needed for a fuel tax to be set optimally. In contrast, an optimal distance tax would require private information. Lastly, relative to the optimal fuel tax, a simple uniform fuel tax is shown to be progressive. Thus, being already deployed worldwide, a uniform fuel tax is an attractive second-best policy. These findings should be accounted for when designing new mechanisms to alleviate motor vehicle pollution.

Literatures on renewables costs are rather sparse, especially on costs of integration and system balancing. The objective of this paper is to fill the research gap by providing an assessment for the cost of Chinas grid-connected renewable energy development and analyze its sharing between different stakeholders. Due to Chinas pricing mechanism of renewable energy and their cost decreasing potential, the pricing model of feed-in tariff and dynamic technological learning processes are employed. In the estimation of purchasing cost, the positive bias is overcome by considering Chinas energy-saving dispatching policy. The results suggest that purchasing cost would be 32.5740.80 billion Yuan over 20122020, and peak in 2017. Grid integration costs which further involve costs of grid infrastructure and system balancing are also investigated. We find that grid infrastructure will cost 27.88 billion Yuan by 2015 and soar to 45.32 billion by 2020, while system balancing will cost 31.49 billion Yuan in 2015 and 63.97 billion Yuan in 2020 among which a substantial part (over 60%) comes from electricity loss in energy transfer. The different parts of these costs are underwritten by disparate participants due to Chinas renewable energy policies and its institutional arrangement. Purchasing cost is shared by power consumers through RES; the cost of grid infrastructure is mainly covered by grid enterprises; and there is no mechanism to specify how to share the cost electricity loss during system balancing which might become a major obstacle for system balancing.

Although many studies have introduced novel models to integrate distributed generation into high levels of EV-adoption scenarios, none has considered EV-embedded battery performance degradation and its economic effect on system planning. Based on well-established models and data to emulate the capacity fading of lithium-ion batteries, the current work presents a mixed-integer linear programming optimization framework with decision variables to size renewable energy resources (RESs) in modern microgrids. The objective function aims to minimize the total cost of the system while guaranteeing a profitable operation level of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) application, narrowing the gap between design stage and real-life daily operation patterns. Stochastic modeling is used to incorporate the effect of different uncertainties involved in the issue. A case study on a residential system in Okinawa, Japan, is introduced to quantitatively illustrate how a profitable V2G operation can affect RES sizing. The results reveal that accounting for the economic operation of EVs leads to the integration of significantly higher capacities of RESs compared with a sizing model that excessively relies on V2G and does not recognize battery-fading economics.

However, it is not widely known that a large number of charged particles in urban environments originate from motor vehicle emissions. In this study, for the first time, we compare the concentrations of charged nanoparticles near busy roads and overhead power lines. We show that large concentrations of both positive and negative charged nanoparticles are present near busy roadways and that these concentrations commonly exceed those under high-voltage power lines. We estimate that the concentration of charged nanoparticles found near two freeways carrying around 120 vehicles per minute exceeded the corresponding maximum concentrations under two corona-emitting overhead power lines by as much as a factor of 5.

The results suggest that the COPERT Australia vehicle emission model is generally accurate at the fleet level, when compared with similar international studies, but under-estimates emissions by 2 to 36%, depending on the pollutant. These findings apply only to the specific measurement conditions in the tunnel (high speed, freeflow). Regression analysis revealed that light and heavy diesel vehicles are consistently and strongly associated with prediction errors across all pollutants. Whereas fleet level prediction of PM emissions by COPERT is good, a substantial under-prediction of PM emissions from diesel trucks is suggested by the statistical analysis. For NOx, the analysis suggests that modern large petrol passenger vehicles (e.g. SUVs) play an important role in the under-estimation of emissions. This indicates that further targeted emissions testing for these vehicles using e.g. PEMS would benefit vehicle emission modelling practice and air quality assessments in Australia. Other tunnel datasets in other cities, preferably of longer duration than a week, could be analysed in a similar fashion to see if these results are confirmed.

Multivariate regression analyses showed average percentage increases in maximum left CIMT of 4.23% (95% CI: 0.32, 8.13) per 1.0 × 10-5/m increase in PM2.5abs; 3.72% (95% CI: 0.32, 7.11) per 10-g/m3 increase in PM10; 2.81% (95% CI: 0.32, 5.31) per 20-g/m3 increase in NO2; and 0.74% (95% CI: 0.08, 1.41) per 10-g/m3 increase in NOx. The associations were not evident for right CIMT, and PM2.5 mass concentration was not associated with the outcomes. Conclusions: Long-term exposures to traffic-related air pollution of PM2.5abs, PM10, NO2, and NOx were positively associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in middle-aged adults.

Objectives: In this study we evaluated whether annual exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with systemic inflammation, which is hypothesized to be an intermediate step to cardiovascular disease. Methods: Six cohorts of adults from Central and Northern Europe were used in this crosssectional study as part of the larger ESCAPE project (European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects). Data on levels of blood markers for systemic inflammationhigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogenwere available for 22,561 and 17,428 persons, respectively. Land use regression models were used to estimate cohort participants&apos; long-term exposure to various size fractions of PM, soot, and nitrogen oxides (NOx). In addition, traffic intensity on the closest street and traffic load within 100 m from home were used as indicators of traffic air pollution exposure. Results: Particulate air pollution was not associated with systemic inflammation. However, cohort participants living on a busy (&gt; 10,000 vehicles/day) road had elevated CRP values (10.2%; 95% CI: 2.4, 18.8%, compared with persons living on a quiet residential street with &lt; 1,000 vehicles/day). Annual NOx concentration was also positively associated with levels of CRP (3.2%; 95% CI: 0.3, 6.1 per 20 g/m3), but the effect estimate was more sensitive to model adjustments. For fibrinogen, no consistent associations were observed. Conclusions: Living close to busy traffic was associated with increased CRP concentrations, a known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, it remains unclear which specific air pollutants are responsible for the association.

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are one of the most promising approaches to decrease emissions. This paper considers the influence of hybridization of transport on energy consumption and emissions on single lanes of road traffic. We have developed a micro-simulation tool which integrates instantaneous consumption and emission models. We have modelled microscopic behaviour of vehicles using a full velocity difference model for longitudinal moving. Then, we have used two macroscopic energy consumption models (COPERT and HBEFA) and an instantaneous energy-consumption model concerning the conventional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicle to illustrate the relevance of microscopic modelling of energy consumption. Furthermore, we have compared the energy consumption of the HEV Toyota Prius with that of the conventional ICE vehicle. An emission model emissions from traffic (EMIT) was also implemented and extended in order to estimate HEV emissions. The model is used to quantify CO2and CO emissions for the HEV Toyota Prius and the conventional ICE vehicle. Moreover, we have studied the influence of fleet hybridization level on energy consumption for congested and uncongested traffic flow state. HEVs can offer major environmental improvements as well as substantial reductions of energy consumption and road traffic emissions. Hybridization is a relevant solution to reduce energy consumption and emissions.

We find that estimates based on marginal vs average grid emission factors differ by as much as 50% (using National Electricity Reliability Commission (NERC) regional boundaries). Use of state boundaries versus NERC region boundaries results in estimates that differ by as much as 120% for the same location (using average emission factors). We argue that consumption-based marginal emission factors are conceptually appropriate for evaluating the emissions implications of policies that increase electric vehicle sales or use in a region. We also examine generation-based marginal emission factors to assess robustness. Using these two estimates of NERC region marginal emission factors, we find the following: (1) delayed charging (i.e., starting at midnight) leads to higher emissions in most cases due largely to increased coal in the marginal generation mix at night; (2) the Chevrolet Volt has higher expected life cycle emissions than the Toyota Prius hybrid electric vehicle (the most efficient U.S. gasoline vehicle) across the U.S. in nearly all scenarios; (3) the Nissan Leaf BEV has lower life cycle emissions than the Prius in the western U.S. and in Texas, but the Prius has lower emissions in the northern Midwest regardless of assumed charging scheme and marginal emissions estimation method; (4) in other regions the lowest emitting vehicle depends on charge timing and emission factor estimation assumptions.

Prominent scenario studies predict that comparable dynamics will continue in the coming decades, which will further improve the environmental performance of Germany&apos;s electricity supply. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is the methodology commonly used to evaluate environmental performance. Previous LCA studies on electric vehicles have shown that the electricity supply for the vehicles&apos; operation is responsible for the major part of their environmental impact. The core question of this study is how the prospective dynamic development of the German electricity mix will affect the impact of electric vehicles operated in Germany and how LCA can be adapted to analyze this impact in a more robust manner. The previously suggested approach of time-resolved LCA, which is located between static and dynamic LCA, is used in this study and compared with several static approaches. Furthermore, the uncertainty issue associated with scenario studies is addressed in general and in relation to time-resolved LCA. Two scenario studies relevant to policy making have been selected, but a moderate number of modifications have been necessary to adapt the data to the requirements of a life cycle inventory. A potential, fully electric vehicle powered by a supercapacitor energy storage system is used as a generic example. The results show that substantial improvements in the environmental repercussions of the electricity supply and, consequentially, of electric vehicles will be achieved between 2020 and 2031 on the basis of the energy mixes predicted in both studies. This study concludes that although scenarios might not be able to predict the future, they should nonetheless be used as data sources in prospective LCA studies, because in many cases historic data appears to be unsuitable for providing realistic information on the future. The time-resolved LCA approach improves the assessment&apos;s robustness substantially, especially when nonlinear developments are foreseen in the future scenarios. This allows for a reduction of bias in LCA-based decision making. However, a deeper integration of time-resolved data in the life cycle inventory and the implementation of a more suitable software framework are desirable. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2015;11:425-434. © 2015 SETAC Key Points The study describes how life cycle assessment&apos;s (LCA) robustness can be improved by respecting prospective fluctuations, like the transition of the German electricity mix, in the modeling of the life cycle inventory. It presents a feasible and rather simple process to add time-resolved data to LCA., The study selects 2 different future scenarios from important German studies and processes their data systematically to make them compatible with the requirements of a life cycle inventory. The use of external scenarios as basis for future-oriented LCA is reflected critically., A case study on electric mobility is presented and used to compare historic, prospective static, and prospective time-resolved electricity mix modeling approaches. The case study emphasizes the benefits of time-resolved LCA in direct comparison with the currently used approaches.

Incorporated with annual vehicle mile traveled (VMT) by Highways Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) vehicle class, MOVES allocates VMT from HPMS to MOVES source (vehicle) types and calculates emission burden by MOVES source type. However, the calculated running emission burden by MOVES source type may be deviated from the actual emission burden because of MOVES source population, specifically the population fraction by MOVES source type in HPMS vehicle class. The deviation is also the result of the use of the universal set of parameters, i.e., relative mileage accumulation rate (relativeMAR), packaged in MOVES default database. This paper presents a novel approach by adjusting the relativeMAR to eliminate the impact of MOVES source population on running exhaust emission and to keep start and evaporative emissions unchanged for both MOVES2010b and MOVES2014. Results from MOVES runs using this approach indicated significant improvements on VMT distribution and emission burden estimation for each MOVES source type. The deviation of VMT by MOVES source type is minimized by using this approach from 12% to less than 0.05% for MOVES2010b and from 50% to less than 0.2% for MOVES2014 except for MOVES source type 53. Source type 53 still remains about 30% variation. The improvement of VMT distribution results in the elimination of emission burden deviation for each MOVES source type. For MOVES2010b, the deviation of emission burdens decreases from 12% for particulate matter less than 2.5 m (PM2.5) and 9% for carbon monoxide (CO) to less than 0.002%. For MOVES2014, it drops from 80% for CO and 97% for PM2.5to 0.006%. Implications:This approach is developed to more accurately estimate the total emission burdens using EPAs MOVES, both MOVES2010b and MOVES2014, by redistributing vehicle mile traveled (VMT) by Highways Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) class to MOVES source type on the basis of comprehensive traffic study, local link-by-link VMT broken down into MOVES source type.

The most common of these are bioethanol and biodiesel that are blended with petroleum based gasoline and diesel fuels at varying percentages. This provides some reduction in the fossil carbon emissions from these fuels. Biomethane (produced from biogas) can and is used as a vehicle fuel to a much more limited extent. Significant modifications are required for the motor vehicle to use biomethane. The use of bioethanol blended fuels leads to increases in emissions of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, with an accompanying decrease in benzene emissions. Nitrogen oxides (NO x ) emissions are often increased with the use of bioethanol. The use of biodiesel blended fuels generally leads to increased NO x emissions, and decreases in particulate matter (PM) emissions. The use of biomethane is expected to have little adverse impact on the emissions from the combustion process, but it will lead to increased emissions of methane due to leakage and unburned fuel emissions. Methane is a stronger greenhouse gas than CO 2 , which is the greenhouse gas emitted in largest quantities from all combustion processes. With the appropriate time and effort, operating and emission control technologies can be developed to minimize the adverse effects that biofuel use will have on vehicle emissions. But this will require that vehicles be properly designed for the use of specific biofuels or biofuel blends. Renewable fuels may lead to decreases in greenhouse gas emissions, even with increasing use of transport fuels. No improvement, and more likely deteriorating air quality, is expected in the future with increasing renewable fuel use.

We compare the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from different natural gas pathways for medium and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs). For Class 8 tractor-trailers and refuse trucks, none of the natural gas pathways provide emissions reductions per unit of freight-distance moved compared to diesel trucks. When compared to the petroleum-based fuels currently used in these vehicles, CNG and centrally produced LNG increase emissions by 0-3% and 2-13%, respectively, for Class 8 trucks. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) powered with natural gas-produced electricity are the only fuel-technology combination that achieves emission reductions for Class 8 transit buses (31% reduction compared to the petroleum-fueled vehicles). For non-Class 8 trucks (pick-up trucks, parcel delivery trucks, and box trucks), BEVs reduce emissions significantly (31-40%) compared to their diesel or gasoline counterparts. CNG and propane achieve relatively smaller emissions reductions (0-6% and 19%, respectively, compared to the petroleum-based fuels), while other natural gas pathways increase emissions for non-Class 8 MHDVs. While using natural gas tofuel electric vehicles could achieve large emission reductions for medium-duty trucks, the results suggest there are no great opportunities to achieve large emission reductions for Class 8 trucks through natural gas pathways with current technologies. There are strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of using natural gas for MHDVs, ranging from increasing vehicle fuel efficiency, reducing life cycle methane leakage rate, to achieving the same payloads and cargo volumes as conventional diesel trucks.

Using the Technology Warming Potential methodology, we assess the climate implications of a diesel to natural gas switch in heavy-duty trucks. We consider spark ignition (SI) and high-pressure direct injection (HPDI) natural gas engines and compressed and liquefied natural gas. Given uncertainty surrounding several key assumptions and the potential for technology to evolve, results are evaluated for a range of inputs for well-to-pump natural gas loss rates, vehicle efficiency, and pump-to-wheels (in-use) methane emissions. Using reference case assumptions reflecting currently available data, we find that converting heavy-duty truck fleets leads to damages to the climate for several decades: around 70-90 years for the SI cases, and 50 years for the more efficient HPDI. Our range of results indicates that these fuel switches have the potential to produce climate benefits on all time frames, but combinations of significant well-to-wheels methane emissions reductions and natural gas vehicle efficiency improvements would be required.

In this study, impact of the low emission vehicles is assessed using AIM/Enduse model with 10 regions in Japan. The model is revised to integrate power generation sector and to separate the transportation demand into small, medium and large size vehicles in order to reflect the availability of BEV and fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) in each vehicle size. In the Reference case, hybrid vehicle accounts for more than a half of transport demand in 2050.

In addition, electricity demand pattern is transformed by demand side management in 2050 while integrating more intermittent renewable energy into electricity system.

The insertion of PEVs in households will facilitate the use of renewable sources and possibly create economic benefits to users, as shown in a Mexican example here presented, but also will introduce some challenges such as how the penetration of PEVs affect the quality of existing power grids. The contribution of this work is to review the literature in reference to the power quality problems and to test them in a real distribution system based on the Mueller community in Austin, Texas that has PEVs and photovoltaic panels (PVs). The results show that a coordinated delay charge mode reduces the loading on transformers at peak hours and improves voltage regulation. Additionally, it is shown that photovoltaic panels introduce a power factor reduction during daytime in the main feeder. Corrective measures should be considered for high levels of PV penetration, such as reactive power support, VAr compensators or community energy storage, which can be presented as one potential solution to most of the problems listed in current literature. However, more research needs to be done in a much broader scale because power systems differ from each other and between countries, but there is a consensus that high power demand by PEVs leads to voltage statutory violations at some points in the grid and smart charging is required to operate the system efficiently.

Six of the most economically developed and populated regions in China and the U.S. were selected. The results showed that EV fuel-cycle emissions depend substantially on the carbon intensity and cleanness of the electricity mix, and vary significantly across the regions studied. In those regions with a low share of coal-based electricity ( e.g ., California), EVs can reduce GHG and air pollutant emissions (except for PM) significantly compared with conventional vehicles. However, in the Chinese regions and selected U.S. Midwestern states where coal dominates in the generation mix, EVs can reduce GHG emissions but increase the total and urban emissions of air pollutants. In 2025, EVs will offer greater reductions in GHG and air pollutant emissions because emissions from power plants will be better controlled; EVs in the Chinese regions examined, however, may still increase SO 2 and PM emissions. Reductions of 6085% in GHGs and air pollutants could be achieved were EVs charged with 80% renewable electricity or the electricity generated from the best available technologies of coal-fired power plants, which are futuristic power generation scenarios.

This study evaluates the incremental life cycle air emissions (climate change and human health) impacts and life cycle ownership costs of non-plug-in (CV and HEV) and plug-in light-duty vehicles. Replacing a gasoline CV with a CNG CV, or a CNG CV with a CNG HEV, can provide life cycle air emissions impact benefits without increasing ownership costs; however, the NG-e BEV will likely increase costs (90% confidence interval: $1000 to $31000 incremental cost per vehicle lifetime). Furthermore, eliminating HEV tailpipe emissions via plug-in vehicles has an insignificant incremental benefit, due to high uncertainties, with emissions cost benefits between -$1000 and $2000. Vehicle criteria air contaminants are a relatively minor contributor to life cycle air emissions impacts because of strict vehicle emissions standards. Therefore, policies should focus on adoption of plug-in vehicles in nonattainment regions, because CNG vehicles are likely more cost-effective at providing overall life cycle air emissions impact benefits.

Previous studies point out to different impact levels with the introduction of electric vehicles in the country&apos;s electric grid, varying from small impacts for substitution of 10 % of the fleet, to potential difficulties if more than 20 % of the fleet is replaced. Electric vehicles offer significant advantages over their internal combustion engine powered vehicles counterparts, including the higher efficiency and performance of the electric motor, reduced pollution emissions during operation, and decreased noise levels. The current disadvantages lie mainly with the higher vehicle and battery costs, relatively long battery-charging period required, limited battery lifetime, and the need to increase market availability. Brazil&apos;s electricity generation capacity is primarily based on clean and renewable energy (hydropower, wind, biomass), providing the preferred approach to charge electric vehicles with minimal carbon and other pollutant emissions. With the introduction of smart grids in the country&apos;s electricity distribution structure, electric vehicles also provide a pathway (with renewable energy options) toward cleaner electricity, leveling the power demand cycle, and lowering the need to add costly central station generation by integrating them into the grid itself during periods when they are not used for transportation. However, careful studies must be conducted mainly due to the need to increase electric power generation to meet existing and imminent demands.

We find that annual energy consumption of BEVs can increase by an average of 15% in the Upper Midwest or in the Southwest compared to the Pacific Coast due to temperature differences. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from BEVs vary primarily with marginal regional grid mix, which has three times the GHG intensity in the Upper Midwest as on the Pacific Coast. However, even within a grid region, BEV emissions vary by up to 22% due to spatial and temporal ambient temperature variation and its implications for vehicle efficiency and charging duration and timing. Cold climate regions also encounter days with substantial reduction in EV range: the average range of a Nissan Leaf on the coldest day of the year drops from 70 miles on the Pacific Coast to less than 45 miles in the Upper Midwest These regional differences are large enough to affect adoption patterns and energy and environmental implications of BEVs relative to alternatives.

In this study, a Harvard Impactor was used to collect daily integrated fine and coarse particle samples every third day for 9 years at a single site in Boston, MA. In total, 1,960 filters were analyzed for elements, black carbon (BC), and total PM mass. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was used to identify source types and quantify their contributions to ambient PM2.5and PM2.510. BC and 17 elements were identified as the main constituents in our samples. Results showed that BC, S, and Pb were associated exclusively with the fine particle mode, while 84% of V and 79% of Ni were associated with this mode. Elements mostly found in the coarse mode, over 80%, included Ca, Mn (road dust), and Cl (sea salt). PMF identified six source types for PM2.5and three source types for PM2.510. Source types for PM2.5included regional pollution, motor vehicles, sea salt, crustal/road dust, oil combustion, and wood burning. Regional pollution contributed the most, accounting for 48% of total PM2.5mass, followed by motor vehicles (21%) and wood burning (19%). Source types for PM2.510included crustal/road dust (62%), motor vehicles (22%), and sea salt (16%). A linear decrease in PM concentrations with time was observed for both fine (5.2%/yr) and coarse (3.6%/yr) particles. The fine-mode trend was mostly related to oil combustion and regional pollution contributions. Average PM2.5concentrations peaked in summer (10.4 µg/m3), while PM2.510concentrations were lower and demonstrated little seasonal variability. The findings of this study show that PM2.5is decreasing more sharply than PM2.510over time. This suggests the increasing importance of PM2.510and traffic-related sources for PM exposure and future policies. Implications:Although many studies have examined fine and coarse particle composition and sources, few studies have used concurrent measurements of these two fractions. Our analysis suggests that fine and coarse particles exhibit distinct compositions and sources. With better knowledge of the compositional and source differences between these two PM fractions, better decisions can be made about PM regulations. Further, such information is valuable in enabling epidemiologists to understand the ensuing health implications of PM exposure.

While some studies evaluated their long-term correlation, little is known about their short-term correlation. Our aim was to study the correlation of short-term noise, ultrafine (&lt;0.1 m) particulate matter number concentration (UFP), and traffic flow in urban areas. A secondary aim was to document the temporal variability of these short-term measurements. We simultaneously measured traffic noise levels, UFP concentrations as well as motor vehicles flows for 20 min in 141 locations, on one to three occasions, in three middle size European cities (Basel, Girona, Grenoble). The reproducibility of the short-term noise measurements and traffic counts over time was high, as reported by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which quantified the agreement between repeated measurements (ICC = 0.860.97, according to city, for noise and ICC = 0.930.94 for traffic counts); this was not the case for UFP number concentrations (ICC = 0.11 to 0.14). The Pearson correlations of simultaneous 20-min measurements of UFP number concentrations and noise levels were in the 0.430.55 range, depending on the city; correlations between noise levels and vehicle counts varied from 0.54 to 0.72; and correlations between UFP concentrations and vehicle counts were lower ( r = 0.150.37 depending on the city). Measurements during as little time as 20 min of outdoor noise and traffic, but not of UFP, were strongly reproducible over durations of a couple of days or months in middle-size European cities. In these areas, on the short-term, noise levels and UFP concentrations exhibited relatively moderate correlations, which may allow adjustment for mutual confounding in epidemiological studies, thus allowing to disentangle their possible short-term health effects.

Experiments were carried out in Ribeirão Preto, in the Southeastern Brazil, with more than 660,000 inhabitants and a fleet of more than 485,000 motor vehicles. Ten seedlings of T. pallida were exposed in three areas in the city, differing in traffic vehicle flow, in two seasons (wet and dry). At the end of each sampling period, which lasted 4 months, samples of leaves were collected, and the content of As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, P, Pb, S, and Zn was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The same elements were determined in soil samples for a seasonal characterization in conjunction with secondary data of environmental parameters. Additionally, micronucleus assay with early pollen tetrad cells of Tradescantia (Trad-MN) was conducted by collecting flower buds and analyzing the micronuclei frequencies in pollen mother cells. Although pollutant levels in air were below the Brazilian legal limits, plants exposed in the high-traffic flow area presented higher concentrations of elements related to vehicle emissions, especially under dry conditions, and higher micronuclei frequency in pollen mother cells. These results show the sensitivity of T. pallida to low-level urban air pollution and its suitability as bioindicator for trace elements. This alternative tool for biomonitoring can serve as a support methodology for the adoption of more restrictive public environmental policies in Brazil and extendible to other developing countries.

Hence, to contribute to fulfill this gap of knowledge, some physicochemical characteristics and toxicological endpoints ( i.e. cytotoxicity, oxidative damage, cytokine secretion) of PM 2.50.3 samples produced during two different seasons ( i.e. spring/summer or autumn/winter) in three different surroundings ( i.e. rural, urban, or industrial) were studied, thereby expecting to differentiate their respective adverse effects in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). Physicochemical characteristics were closely related to respective origins and seasons of the six PM 2.50.3 samples, highlighting the respective contributions of industrial and heavy motor vehicle traffic sources. Space- and season-dependent differences in cytotoxicity of the six PM 2.50.3 samples could only be supported by considering both the physicochemical properties and the variance in air PM concentrations. Whatever spaces and seasons, dose- and even time-dependent increases in oxidative damage and cytokine secretion were reported in PM 2.50.3 -exposed BEAS-2B cells. However, the relationship between the chemical composition of each of the six PM 2.50.3 samples and their oxidative or inflammatory potentials seemed to be very complex. These results supported the role of inorganic, ionic and organic components as exogenous source of Reactive Oxygen Species and, thereafter, cytokine secretion. Nevertheless, one of the most striking observation was that some inorganic, ionic and organic chemical components were preferentially associated with early oxidative events whereas others in the later oxidative damage and/or cytokine secretion. Taken together, these results indicated that PM mass concentration alone might not be able to explain the health outcomes, because PM is chemically nonspecific, and supported growing evidence that PM-size, composition and emission source, together with sampling season, interact in a complex manner to produce PM 2.50.3 -induced human adverse health effects.

Changing people&apos;s travel behaviour towards alternative transport is an efficient approach to mitigate harmful environmental impacts caused by a large number of vehicles. Such a strategy also provides an opportunity to gain health co-benefits of improved air quality and enhanced physical activities. This study aimed at quantifying co-benefit effects of alternative transport use in Adelaide, South Australia. Method We made projections for a business-as-usual scenario for 2030 with alternative transport scenarios. Separate models including air pollution models and comparative risk assessment health models were developed to link alternative transport scenarios with possible environmental and health benefits. Results In the study region with an estimated population of 1.4 million in 2030, by shifting 40% of vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) by passenger vehicles to alternative transport, annual average urban PM 2.5 would decline by approximately 0.4 g/m 3 compared to business-as-usual, resulting in net health benefits of an estimated 13 deaths/year prevented and 118 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) prevented per year due to improved air quality. Further health benefits would be obtained from improved physical fitness through active transport (508 deaths/year prevented, 6569 DALYs/year prevented), and changes in traffic injuries (21 deaths and, 960 DALYs prevented). Conclusion Although uncertainties remain, our findings suggest that significant environmental and health benefits are possible if alternative transport replaces even a relatively small portion of car trips. The results may provide assistance to various government organisations and relevant service providers and promote collaboration in policy-making, city planning and infrastructure establishment.

In the installation area of a large PV system, appropriate operation is required, for example, of a method considering power output fluctuation and solar radiation forecast errors. In addition, it is better to minimise the size of the battery and its capital cost. This paper proposes an optimisation approach to determine the operational planning of the power output for a large PV system. This approach includes the method of determination of the charge/discharge amount for the battery of an electric vehicle as a demand response. The method aims to obtain a more beneficial deal with the sale of electrical power. The optimisation method applies the genetic algorithm to smoothen the fluctuating power output due to the PV system, and also to determine the initial state of charge of the battery.

DCDC converters have made a successful transition from single inputsingle output to multiinputmultioutput converters.

The review covers a broad range of topics related to electric vehicles, such as the basic types of these vehicles and their technical characteristics, fuel economy and CO 2 emissions, the electric vehicle charging mechanisms and the notions of grid to vehicle and vehicle to grid architectures. In particular three main types of electric vehicles, namely, the hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), the plug-in electric vehicles (PHEVs) and the full electric vehicles (FEVs) are discussed in detailed. The major difference between these types of vehicles is that for the last two types, the battery can be externally recharged. In addition, FEVs operate only on battery charge and therefore always employ the charge depleting mode of operation requiring high power, high energy battery packs. On the other hand, PHEVs offer the possibility of on-board battery charging and the option of charge depleting or charge sustaining modes of operation. Finally HEVs, which were the first type of electric vehicles to be manufactured, offer higher travelling range compared to PHEVs and FEVs due to the existence of the internal combustion engine. Although tank-to-wheel efficiencies of electric vehicles show that they have higher fuel economies than conventional gasoline vehicles, the well-to-wheel efficiency is a more appropriate measure to use for comparing fuel economy and CO 2 emissions in order to account for the effect of electricity consumption from these vehicles. From the perspective of a full cycle analysis, the electricity available to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources in order for such vehicles to have zero emissions.

Scenario analysis shows that scrappage can provide significant emission reductions as soon as the measures begin, whereas retrofit provides greater emission reductions in later years, when more advanced technologies become available in most regions. Reductions are compared with a baseline that already accounts for implementation of clean vehicle standards. The greatest global emission reductions from a scrappage program occur 5 to 10 years after its introduction and can reach as much as 70%. The greatest reductions with retrofit occur around 2030 and range from 16-31%. Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate how uncertainties in the composition of the vehicle fleet affect predicted reductions. Scrappage and retrofit reduce global emissions by 22-60% and 15-31%, respectively, within 95% confidence intervals, under a midrange scenario in the year 2030. The simulations provide guidance about which strategies are most effective for specific regions. Retrofit is preferable for high-income regions. For regions where early emission standards are in place, scrappage is suggested, followed by retrofit after more advanced emission standards are introduced. The early implementation of advanced emission standards is recommended for Western and Eastern Africa.

All of the buses tested were fitted with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems except for the Euro-III diesel buses. A SEMTECH-DS was used for testing the gaseous pollutants, and an electric low pressure impactor (ELPI) was used for measuring of particle numbers and size distributions. A comparison was made based on emission performance of these buses by employing the VSP approach and fuel- based emissions factors. Diesel buses emitted less CO and THC but more NO x and PM pollutants than CNG buses. The NO x reduction efficiencies of the SCR systems for CNG buses were higher because of the high exhaust temperature and high NO 2 /NO x ratio, whereas the efficiencies for diesel buses were lower. This resulted in extremely low NO x emissions from CNG buses, but the high NO 2 /NO x ratio needs further study. Failures of urea injection in the SCR systems were detected in this research, which resulted in very high NO x emissions. The CNG buses also emitted smaller numbers of particles and less particle mass with the presence of oxidation catalysts. Diesel buses satisfying the Euro-V standard performed better than Euro-IV and Euro-III diesel buses in terms of emission performance, except for more nuclei mode particles. Most of time, the Euro-IV diesel buses show no advantages in CO and NO x emissions compared with the Euro-III diesel buses.

The V2G concept eases the integration of renewable energy resources into power system and gives a new force to the inevitable move towards power generation by clean energy resources. Therefore, trends in utilizing energy stored in PEVs will bring undeniable economic and environmental benefits. The V2G aspect has been the field of many research works in the last few years.

We analyze the impacts of battery characteristics, often-overlooked driver preferences and road network features on PHEV travel costs for long-distance trips and compare the results with hybrid electric and conventional vehicles. We investigate the significance of these factors and derive critical managerial insights for shaping the future investment decisions about PHEVs and their infrastructure. In particular, our findings suggest that with a certain level of deployment of fast charging stations, well established cost and emission benefits of PHEVs for the short range trips can be extended to long distance.

Most of renewable distributed energy sources are capable of operating in two modes, which are constant voltage and constant power modes. Different simulation results were obtained for voltage stability index (VSI), which serves as indicator of stability. Furthermore, this study has also considered charging station (CS) as a load, that is, gradually increased at the selected bus until the system attains instability state. The persistence of the instability can lead to voltage collapse, and VSI value can give an indication of the collapse as well. In this paper, the concept of active power voltage stability index (P-VSI) is introduced with the aim of predicting the voltage collapse as a result of incremental CS loading in the network. Based on the analysis conducted in radial networks with multiple distributed generation units, the P-VSI gave better indication for the voltage collapse much more than reactive power voltage stability index. The analysis was conducted on 33 bus distribution system. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

However, the understanding of the real-world emissions of NGVs is very limited. In this study, the emissions from 20 compressed-natural-gas-fueled bi-fuel taxis were measured using a portable emission measurement system (PEMS) under actual driving conditions in Yichang, China. The emission characteristics of the tested vehicles were analyzed, revealing that the average CO2, CO, HC and NOx emissions from the tested compressed-natural-gas (CNG) taxis under urban driving conditions were 1.6, 4.0, 2.0 and 0.98 times those under highway road conditions, respectively. The CO, HC and NOx emissions from Euro 3 CNG vehicles were approximately 40%, 55% and 44% lower than those from Euro 2 vehicles, respectively. Compared with the values for light-duty gasoline vehicles reported in the literature, the CO2 and CO emissions from the tested CNG taxis were clearly lower; however, significant increases in the HC and NOx emissions were observed. Finally, we normalized the emissions under the actual driving cycles of the entire test route to the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC)-based emissions using a VSP modes method developed by North Carolina State University. The simulated NEDC-based CO emissions from the tested CNG taxis were better than the corresponding emissions standards, whereas the simulated NEDC-based HC and NOx emissions greatly exceeded the standards. Thus, more attention should be paid to the emissions from CNG vehicles. As for the CNG-fueled bi-fuel taxis currently in use, the department of environmental protection should strengthen their inspection and supervision to reduce the emissions from these vehicles. The results of this study will be helpful in understanding and controlling emissions from CNG-fueled bi-fuel vehicles in China.

However, the future availability of lithium is uncertain, and the feasibility of manufacturing lithium batteries at sufficient scale has been questioned. The levels of lithium demand growth implied by electric vehicle deployment scenarios is significant, particularly where scenarios are consistent with global GHG reduction targets. This paper examines the question of future lithium availability for the manufacturing of lithium batteries for electric vehicles. In this paper we first examine some of the existing literature in this area, highlighting the levels of future lithium demand previously considered and pointing to the variables that give rise to the range of outcomes in these assessments. We then investigate the ways in which lithium availability is calculated in the literature based on both lithium demand from electric vehicles and lithium supply from both brines and ore. This paper particularly focuses on the key variables needed to make an assessment of future lithium availability. On the demand side, these variables include future market size of electric vehicles, their average battery capacity and the material intensity of the batteries. The key supply variables include global reserve and resource estimates, forecast production and recyclability. We found that the literature informing assumptions regarding the key variables is characterised by significant uncertainty. This uncertainty gives rise to a wide range of estimates for the future demand for lithium based on scenarios consistent with as 50% reduction in global emissions by 2050 at between 184,000 and 989,000t of lithium per year in 2050. However, lithium production is forecast to grow to between 75,000 and 110,000t per year by 2020. Under this rate of production growth, it is plausible that lithium supply will meet increasing lithium demand over the coming decades to 2050.

Distributed generation technique is a primary way to utilize renewable energy. Microgrid integrated with different kinds of distributed resources can improve energy efficiency and reduce the negative impact on power grid. Microgrid may operate in grid-connected or islanding mode, running on quite different strategies. Effective islanding detection methods are indispensable to realize optimal operation of microgrid. In this paper, performance indices and critical technique problems are discussed. Islanding detection methods are also classified. The paper aims to discuss the improvement of several performance indices, including non-detection zone (NDZ), detection time, error detection ratio and power quality, to evaluate different detection methods.

It has put forward this plan containing the most stringent emission control policies and strategies to be adopted for on-road vehicles of Beijing. This paper estimates the historic and future trends and uncertainties in vehicle emissions of Beijing from 1998 to 2020 by applying a new emission factor model for the Beijing vehicle fleet (EMBEV). Our updated results show that total emissions of CO, THC, NO x  and PM2.5 from the Beijing vehicle fleet are 507 (395819) kt, 59.1 (41.290.5) kt, 74.7 (54.9103.9) kt and 2.69 (1.914.17) kt, respectively, at a 95% confidence level. This represents significant reductions of 58%, 59%, 31% and 62%, respectively, relative to the total vehicle emissions in 1998. The past trends clearly posed a challenge to NOx emission mitigation for the Beijing vehicle fleet, especially in light of those increasing NO x  emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) which have partly offset the reduction benefit from light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGVs). Because of recently announced vehicle emission controls to be adopted in Beijing, including tighter emissions standards, limitations on vehicle growth by more stringent license control, promotion of alternative fuel technologies (e.g., natural gas) and the scrappage of older vehicles, estimated vehicle emissions in Beijing will continue to be mitigated by 74% of CO, 68% of THC, 56% of NO x  and 72% of PM2.5 in 2020 compared to 2010 levels. Considering that many of the megacities in China are facing tremendous pressures to mitigate emissions from on-road vehicles, our assessment will provide a timely case study of significance for policy-makers in China.

Four passes (two round-trips) were made at four different fleet speeds (i.e., 45, 65, 75 and 85 km h1). Individual NMHC and CO mixing ratios were observed to be sensitive to the fleet speed, which is compounded by driving conditions and traffic volumes. We propose using ratios of NMHCs to CO to cancel out the factor of traffic volumes to determine CO-normalized NMHC emissions, such that a less biased comparison can be made between different fleet speeds in this study and even between different studies. Moreover, to obtain robust CO-normalized NMHC emissions which are sufficiently representative of the fleet speeds, only samples collected deep inside the long-tunnels between 8 and 12 km were used. Of the 61 target NMHCs, isomers of butane, pentane, ethylene, acetylene and toluene were the most abundant species regardless of the driving conditions. We observed that different driving conditions not only affected the emission strengths but also altered the compositions of the NMHCs. To simplify the data analysis, the target NMHCs were classified into four chemical groups, i.e., alkanes, alkenes, aromatics and alkynes. For the slower and more congested driving condition (fleet speed = 45 km h1), the CO-normalized NMHC emissions were the highest, with alkanes contributing to approximately 60% of the total NMHC levels, suggesting poorer fuel utilization at slower driving conditions. In terms of the CO-normalized ozone forming potentials (OFPs), the contribution of the alkanes diminished dramatically to approximately 922% despite their high weight percentage, whereas the contribution of the alkenes was enhanced significantly to 5060% from their weight percent of only approximately 26%. Our total NMHC to CO ratios of 0.060.20 for the four fleet speeds generally fall within the range constrained by many other tunnel or chassis dynamometer studies; however, the sensitivity to the driving conditions and the robustness with the long-tunnel data are better demonstrated in this study.

The concept goal of the smart grid along with the future deployment of the EVs puts forward various challenges in terms of electric grid infrastructure, communication and control. Following an intensive review on advanced smart metering and communication infrastructures, the strategy for integrating the EVs into the electric grid is presented. Various EV smart charging technologies are also extensively examined with the perspective of their potential, impacts and limitations under the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) phenomenon. Moreover, the high penetration of renewable energy sources (wind and photovoltaic solar) is soaring up into the power system. However, their intermittent power output poses different challenges on the planning, operation and control of the power system networks. On the other hand, the deployment of EVs in the energy market can compensate for the fluctuations of the electric grid. In this context, a literature review on the integration of the renewable energy and the latest feasible solution using EVs with the insight of the promising research gap to be covered up are investigated. Furthermore, the feasibility of the smart V2G system is thoroughly discussed. In this paper, the EVs interactions with the smart grid as the future energy system model are extensively discussed and research gap is revealed for the possible solutions.

This study assessed the environmental costs and benefits of these bus technologies in Greater London relative to the existing fleet and characterized emissions changes due to alternative technologies. We found a &gt;30% increase in CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions for CNG buses, a &lt;5% change for exhaust treatment scenarios, and a 13% (90% confidence interval 3.8-20.9%) reduction for HEB relative to baseline CO2e emissions. A multiscale regional chemistry-transport model quantified the impact of alternative bus technologies on air quality, which was then related to premature mortality risk. We found the largest decrease in population exposure (about 83%) to particulate matter (PM2.5) occurred with LB-CNG buses. Monetized environmental and investment costs relative to the baseline gave estimated net present cost of LB-CNG or HEB conversion to be $187 million ($73 million to $301 million) or $36 million ($-25 million to $102 million), respectively, while EGR or SCRT estimated net present costs were $19 million ($7 million to $32 million) or $15 million ($8 million to $23 million), respectively.

Electric vehicles (EVs) appear as one alternative to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy resources. This research work analyzes the benefits of the introduction of EVs in a small energy system, the Flores island, Azores, in terms of primary energy and CO2 emissions. Four scenarios were designed considering different penetration rates of EVs (Low and High) and different time of recharging strategies (Fixed and Flexible). The high shares of RES in the electricity production system (6062%) did not guarantee a significant use of RES for the recharging of EVs (1040%), as the additional electricity required had to be produced mainly from the diesel generators. The flexible recharging strategies allowed doubling the share of RES in the recharging of the EVs when compared to fixed recharging, and consequently double the impact on the reduction of primary energy consumption and fossil fuels imports. While the reduction of primary energy ranged between 0.2% and 1.1%, for CO2 emissions there was a decrease between 0.3 and 1.7%, proving that EVs can help improve the sustainability of energy systems.

We use well-to-wheels (WTW) efficiency to compare alternative NG transportation pathways. If internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) remain prevalent, then compressed natural gas (CNG) is the favored fuel. Among electric powertrains, centralized electricity generation with battery electric vehicle (BEV) is more efficient than on-board generation with fuel-cell vehicles (FCV). Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) balance driving range against WTW efficiency, and provide flexibility in sourcing electricity from different energy sources. Despite these efficient WTW pathways, supplying NG for the LDV sector is estimated to decrease the lifetime of current US NG reserves to about 60 years. Beyond this period, compressed methane derived from biomass can replace CNG, and utilize the would-be developed CNG infrastructure. The LDV biomass requirement depends on the biomass to methane carbon conversion and battery storage capacity of CNG PHEVs. Converting biomass to methane using solar heat/H2 leads to ~65% lower LDV biomass requirement compared to standalone processes recovering ~30% biomass carbon as methane. The resulting biomass amounts compare favorably with future US biomass supply projections.

In this study, on-road vehicle emission inventories of CO and NO x  for Southeast Texas generated by MOVES and MOBILE6.2 in two versions of the 2005 National Emission Inventory (NEI) were studied by comparing predicted CO and NO x  using the EPA&apos;s Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model incorporated with a source-oriented gas phase chemical mechanism with measurements made at six urban and industrial sites in Southeast Texas. The source tracing technique allows direct determination of contributions of on-road vehicles to overall CO and NO x  concentrations and identification of ambient concentration measurements which are mostly impacted by vehicle emissions. By grouping the fractional bias (FB) values of the hourly predictions based on vehicle contributions to total CO or NO x  concentrations, clear trends in the FB were observed, indicating systematic biases in the emission inventory for these species. Data points dominated by vehicle emissions suggest that surface CO concentrations due to vehicle exhaust are significantly over-estimated by a factor of 2 using either MOVES or MOBILE6.2. NO x  concentrations are overestimated by approximately 2035% and 70% by using the MOBILE6.2 and MOVES emissions, respectively. Emission scaling runs show that a domain-wide reduction of MOBILE6.2 CO emissions by 60% and NO x  emissions by 1525% leads to better model performance of exhaust CO and NO x  concentrations in the current study.

VSP depends on vehicle speed, acceleration, and road grade. There is not a standard method for measuring road grade from a moving vehicle. A method for quantifying grade is evaluated based on statistical analysis of multiple runs using low cost consumer grade Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers with in-built Barometric Altimeter (GPS/BA). The average grade precision is ±0.71, ±0.46, and ±0.31 percentage points, for sample sizes of 9, 18, and 36 GPS/BA runs, respectively, among 2213 individual 0.08 km road segments. In addition, 4 sets of repeated measurements were performed on the same routes using a high cost, high accuracy Differential GPS (DGPS). Both sets of GPS-based grade estimates compared well with those derived from LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) data. GPS/BA and DGPS grade estimates were similar, except for high magnitude grades of 810 percent for which DGPS estimates are more accurate. DGPS is more sensitive to loss of signal; thus, a hybrid approach for substituting GPS/BA data for missing DGPS data at specific locations along a route is demonstrated. The local and overall effects of road grade on fuel use and emission rates are investigated for an example light duty gasoline vehicle.

Stop influence zone is defined as the area in which the normal bus driving is interrupted by bus stops. The second-by-second data were screened out within the stop influence zone. And the bus running state near a stop was classified into three driving modes, deceleration, idling, and acceleration. Then emission characteristics were analyzed for each mode. Under the idling condition, the emission rates (g s1) were not constant all the time. The NO X  emission rate decreased in the first 46 s while the corresponding emission rates of CO2, CO, NO X , and HC increased in the last 4 s of idling. Besides, the influence of bus stop characteristics on emissions was investigated using statistical methods. Platform type, length and location of bus stops showed significant effects on the length of the stop influence zone. However, there were no significant effects on distance-based emission factors.

This study compared particle mass and SPN emissions from a heavy-duty diesel vehicle operating over the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) and actual on-road driving conditions. Particle mass emissions were calculated using the integrated particle size distribution (IPSD) method and called MIPSD. TheMIPSD emissions for the UDDS and on-road tests were more than 6 times lower than the U.S. 2007 heavy-duty particulate matter (PM) mass standard. The MIPSD emissions for the UDDS fell between those for the on-road uphill and downhill driving. SPN and MIPSD measurements were dominated by nucleation particles for the UDDS and uphill driving and by accumulation mode particles for cruise and downhill driving. The SPN emissions were 3 times lower than the Euro 6 heavy-duty SPN limit for the UDDS and downhill driving and ~4-5 times higher than the Euro 6 SPN limit for the more aggressive uphill driving; however, it is likely that most of the &quot;solid&quot; particles measured under these conditions were associated with a combination release of stored sulfates and enhanced sulfate formation associated with high exhaust temperatures, leading to growth of volatile particles into the solid particle counting range above 23 nm. Except for these conditions, a linear relationship was found between SPN and accumulation mode MIPSD. The coefficient of variation (COV) of SPN emissions of particles &gt;23 nm ranged from 8 to 26% for the UDDS and on-road tests.

It is particularly challenging to quantify non-exhaust emissions. Source apportionment studies can be used to provide robust information about motor vehicle source chemical profiles and their contribution to ambient PM concentrations. This paper presents the results of the tracer component method (TCM), which has been used to separate exhaust and non-exhaust emissions from the entire source profile for motor vehicles in Auckland by using chemical markers. TCM was applied to ambient PM data collected in Auckland by taking the concentration of black carbon as the lower limit of the exhaust component and the concentration of crustal elements as the lower limit of the non-exhaust component. For PM2.5, the non-exhaust components and the ratios of non-exhaust to total vehicle components (NT ratio) were higher at Queen Street and Khyber Pass (busy traffic sites in the city centre) than at Takapuna and Penrose (outside the city centre). For PM10, the non-exhaust components were also higher at Queen Street and Khyber Pass but the NT ratios were similar across all sites. TCM estimated that the NT ratios were approximately 18.6% and 30.2% for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, which was higher than those in the Auckland vehicle emissions inventory which consisted of exhaust emissions and brake/tyre wear only. In literature, studies have not been found to separate exhaust from non-exhaust components of the entire source profile of motor vehicles.

Currently, a number of federal policies are in place to incentivize deployment of PEVs to mainstream consumers with demographics and vehicle attribute preferences most common to today&apos;s new vehicle purchasers. This article argues that policies intending to give PEVs a foothold in the market should not focus on mainstream consumers and should instead focus on niche marketsspecifically carsharing and postal fleetsand early adopters including green consumers. Two arguments can be made in support of eliminating the mainstream market bias of current policies toward a policy of cultivating niche markets. The first is efficiency: so far PEV policies featuring a mainstream market bias have proven to be inefficient and costly. The second is effectiveness: it is becoming increasingly evident that PEV policies would be more effective in achieving potential societal benefits if they focused on early adopters and niche markets using such approaches as strategic niche management, accessible loans and financing, and appropriately targeted incentives. PEV policies focused on early adopters and niche markets would create complementary system effects that will lead to increased PEV market penetration and realization of intended societal benefits.

However, a major limitation is their relatively short vehicle driving range and the associated driver range anxiety. This research investigates the effect of gearing on energy consumption and driving range efficiency on an EV-converted Ford Focus using a chassis dynamometer in a controlled test environment in accordance with international standards. Two designs of the Ford Focus were used in the tests; one with an automatic gear drive, and the other with a manual gear drive. The electricity consumption of the two cars driving under different gearing configurations was measured under identical drive cycles. The vehicle range tests showed that measuring energy consumption on just two consecutive drive cycles on a calibrated chassis dynamometer will lead to a small overestimation of the energy consumption due to a cold drive train. The results also suggest greater attention needs to be paid to EV battery charger efficiency, particularly in terms of standby energy consumption, which can increase the total energy required for EV owners markedly.

The Multilinear Engine version 2 (ME-2) was used to determine that five sources were responsible for the measured flux at the tower: (i) vehicle exhaust, (ii) a foam plastics industrial source with significant pentane emissions, (iii) consumer and commercial solvent use emissions, (iv) a biogenic emissions source dominated by isoprene, and, (v) evaporative fuel emissions.

The use of fossil fuel in the vehicles is a rising concern due to its harmful environmental effects. Among other sources battery, fuel cell (FC), super capacitors (SC) and photovoltaic cell i.e. solar are studied for vehicle application. Combinations of these sources of renewable energies can be applied for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) for next generation of transportation. Various aspects and techniques of HEV from energy management system (EMS), power conditioning and propulsion system are explored in this paper. Other related fields of HEV such as DC machine and vehicle system are also included. Various type models and algorithms derived from simulation and experiment are explained in details. The performances of the various combination of HEV system are summarized in the table along with relevant references. This paper provides comprehensive survey of hybrid electric vehicle on their source combination, models, energy management system (EMS) etc. developed by various researchers. From the rigorous review, it is observed that the existing technologies more or less can capable to perform HEV well; however, the reliability and the intelligent systems are still not up to the mark.

Vehicle road load simulations were performed on a chassis dynamometer using the three-phase LA-92 unified driving cycle (UDC). Effects of LDV operating conditions and ambient temperature (-7 and 24 °C) on particle-phase semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) emissions were investigated. SVOC concentrations and OC and EC fractions were determined with thermal extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TE-GC-MS) and thermal-optical analysis (TOA), respectively. LDV aerosol emissions were predominantly carbonaceous, and EC/PM (w/w) decreased linearly with increasing fuel ethanol content. TE-GC-MS analysis accounted for up to 4% of the fine particle (PM2.5) mass, showing the UDC phase-integrated sum of identified SVOC emissions ranging from 0.703 g km-1 to 18.8 g km-1. Generally, higher SVOC emissions were associated with low temperature (-7 °C) and engine ignition; mixed regression models suggest these emissions rate differences are significant. Use of e85 significantly reduced the emissions of lower molecular weight PAH. However, a reduction in higher molecular weight PAH entities in PM was not observed. Individual SVOC emissions from the Tier 2 LDVs and fuel technologies tested are substantially lower and distributed differently than those values populating the United States emissions inventories currently. Hence, this study is likely to influence future apportionment, climate, and air quality model predictions that rely on source combustion measurements of SVOCs in PM.

The parking lot survey, GPS monitoring and video camera monitoring were conducted over four typical road types (arterial, highway, residential and outskirt roads). The average age of vehicles in the bus, van, 3-wheeler, taxi and MC fleet was 9, 8.7, 11, 9.5 and 4 years, respectively. There were some extremely old buses (over 40 years old) which had extremely high emission factors. Except for MCs that had a large share of Euro III technology (75%), other types of surveyed vehicles were at most Euro II or lower. The average vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) for each vehicle type was estimated based on odometer readings which showed comparable results with the GPS survey. The emission factors (EFs) produced by the IVE model for the driving and meteorological conditions in Kathmandu were used to estimate emissions for the base case of 2010. EFs in Kathmandu were higher than other developing cities, especially for PM and NO x  from the bus fleet. Diurnal variations of the emissions were consistent with the diurnal vehicle density. From the fleet in 2010, total emissions of the major pollutants, i.e., CO, VOC, NO x , PM, BC, and CO2, were 31, 7.7, 16, 4.7, 2.1, and 1554 Gg, respectively. If the entire fleet in the Kathmandu Valley would comply with Euro III then the emission would decrease, as compared to the base case, by 44% for toxic air pollutants (excluding CO2) and 31% for climate-forcers in terms of the 20-year horizon CO2-equivalent. Future surveys should include other vehicle types such as trucks, personal cars, and non-road vehicles. The EFs obtained for the Euro III scenario in Kathmandu were well above those in other parts of the World, hence strongly suggesting influences of the driving conditions, especially the low vehicle speeds, on the vehicle emission in the valley.

Significant inter-community and less significant but observable intra-community differences in traffic-related pollutant concentrations were observed both in the residential neighborhoods studied and on their arterial roadways between BH, DTLA, and WLA, particularly for ultrafine particles (UFP). HEV, defined as vehicles creating plumes with concentrations more than three standard deviations from the adjusted local baseline, were encountered during 613% of sampling time, during which they accounted for 1755% of total UFP concentrations both on arterial roadways and in residential neighborhoods. If instead a single threshold value is used to define HEVs in all areas, HEV&apos;s were calculated to make larger contributions to UFP concentrations in BH than other communities by factors of 210 or more. Santa Monica Airport located in WLA appears to be a significant source for elevated UFP concentrations in nearby residential neighborhoods 80400 m downwind. In the WLA area, we also showed, on a neighborhood scale, striking and immediate reductions in particulate pollution (70% reductions in both UFP and, somewhat surprisingly, PM2.5), corresponding to dramatic decreases in traffic densities during an I-405 closure event (Carmageddon) compared to non-closure Saturday levels. Although pollution reduction due to decreased traffic is not unexpected, this dramatic improvement in particulate pollution provides clear evidence air quality can be improved through strategies such as heavy-duty-diesel vehicle retrofits, earlier retirement of HEV, and transition to electric vehicles and alternative fuels, with corresponding benefits for public health.

As the level of installed PV capacity increases, it is possible that the aggregated generation mix could produce electrical power exceeding electrical demand, thus requiring generator curtailment. Therefore, determining the optimum penetration of large-scale PV and aggregated technical and economic benefits is becoming an issue for both power utilities and policy makers. We report the development and validation of a new methodology for assessing the optimum capacity and benefits of state-wide grid-connected large scale solar PV systems in Illinois. The solar carve-out portion of the current renewable portfolio standard is also evaluated within the context of the state&apos;s sustainable energy plan for the near term future.

However, dimensioning of hydrogen production systems is complex: renewable energy sources are stochastic in nature, requiring the collection of empirical datasets relating to weather patterns on a daily, seasonal and annual basis; and hydrogen production is characterised by sensitivity to operating conditions and diversity in the performance of the component parts. A probabilistic model is developed for dimensioning of hydrogen production systems that removes the reliance on the collection of empirical datasets and the requirement for detailed performance characterisation of component parts. The model utilises well known correlations and distribution modelling techniques to predict energy output from either a photovoltaic array or wind turbine and hence the number of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) that could be supported on an annual basis. The model was implemented in MatLab and simulation results were compared with existing empirical based studies. Through simulation, limitations of the model were investigated and discussed. It was shown that the model was able to predict the number of FCEVs supported to within 10% (solar pathway) and 22% (wind pathway) for those studies investigated. These results are in alignment with the intention of the model as a first stage tool for the dimensioning of renewable hydrogen energy transport micro-economies.

Small ions rapidly attach to particles in the air and, therefore, studies have shown that they are suppressed in polluted environments. Urban environments, in particular, are dominated by motor vehicle emissions and, since motor vehicles are a source of both particles and small ions, the relationship between these two parameters is not well known. In order to gain a better understanding of this relationship, an intensive campaign was undertaken where particles and small ions of both signs were monitored over two week periods at each of three sites A, B and C that were affected to varying degrees by vehicle emissions. Site A was close to a major road and reported the highest particle number and lowest small ion concentrations. Precursors from motor vehicle emissions gave rise to clear particle formation events on five days and, on each day this was accompanied by a suppression of small ions. Observations at Site B, which was located within the urban airshed, though not adjacent to motor traffic, showed particle enhancement but no formation events. Site C was a clean site, away from urban sources. This site reported the lowest particle number and highest small ion concentration. The positive small ion concentration was 10%40% higher than the corresponding negative value at all sites. These results confirm previous findings that there is a clear inverse relationship between small ions and particles in urban environments dominated by motor vehicle emissions.

These vehicles are promoted as providing distinct consumer and public benefits at the expense of grid electricity. However, the specific benefits or impacts of PHEVs ultimately relies on consumers purchase and vehicle use patterns. While considerable effort has been dedicated to understanding PHEV impacts on a per mile basis few studies have assessed the impacts of PHEV given actual consumer use patterns or operating conditions. Instead, simplifying assumptions have been made about the types of cars individual consumers will choose to purchase and how they will drive and charge them. Here, we highlight some of these consumer purchase and use assumptions, studies which have employed these assumptions and compare these assumptions to actual consumer data recorded in a PHEV demonstration project. Using simulation and hypothetical scenarios we discuss the implication for PHEV impact analyses and policy if assumptions about key PHEV consumer use variables such as vehicle choice, home charging frequency, distribution of driving distances, and access to workplace charging were to change.

Charging EVs from smart microgrids fueled by renewable energy resources is becoming a popular green approach. Although some works have been done on renewable energy sources and EVs in smart microgrids, the stochastic characteristics and the dynamic interplay between these two important green solutions should be carefully considered. Furthermore, one of the important performance metrics, service availability for EVs, is largely ignored in the existing works. In this article, we study the charging policies in smart microgrids with EVs and renewable energy sources. We analyze service availability under different charging policies. Based on the renewable energy sources states, battery states, and the number of charging EVs, an optimal charging policy is obtained to maximize the energy utilization with service availability constraints. We formulate the optimal charging problem as a stochastic decision process. Maximizing the energy utilization with service availability constraints is the objective in our model. Extensive simulation results are presented. It is illustrated that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the service availability for EVs in microgrids fueled by renewable energy sources.

This study comparatively investigated levels of fine particles (PM2.5), SO2, NO2, and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) at fixed roadsides and on traveling routes in congested urban and less congested suburban areas of Bangkok in 2010. The roadside air quality monitoring was done at two opposite sites across the selected roads. The traffic counting was made simultaneously in these roads and hourly flows of 8 different vehicle types were determined. Roadside PM2.5 levels during dry season were high in both the city center and suburban area, significantly above the wet season, with 6575% measurements exceeded 24 h Thailand ambient air quality standard of 50 g m3. Oppositely, roadside BTEX levels measured in the city center during wet season were higher than dry season and well above those in suburban area. Diurnal variations and the results of SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) analysis showed associations between roadside pollutants levels and hourly traffic flows. The differences in pollution levels between 2 monitoring sites across a road were explained by road configurations and prevalent wind directions. On-route pollution levels were measured simultaneously both inside and outside selected vehicles (van, pickup), and on motorcycle. The on-route PM2.5 levels along the urban route were higher during the dry season than wet season. PM2.5 levels inside the vehicles were lower than outside whereas the opposite was observed for BTEX. BTEX were higher on more congested urban sub-routes with lower vehicle speeds. Higher pollution levels suggest a high risk of exposure.

We model EV adoption scenarios in each of six regions of the Eastern Interconnection, containing 70% of the United States population. We develop electricity system optimization models at the multidecade, day-ahead, and hour-ahead time scales, incorporating spatial wind energy modeling, endogenous modeling of CV efficiencies, projections for EV efficiencies, and projected CV and EV costs. We find two means to reduce total consumer expenditure (TCE): (i) controlling charge timing and (ii) unlinking the fuel economy regulations for CVs from EVs. Although EVs provide minimal direct GHG reductions, controlled charging provides load flexibility, lowering the cost of renewable electricity. Without EVs, a 33% renewable electricity standard (RES) would cost $193/vehicle-year more than the reference case (10% RES). Combining a 33% RES, EVs with controlled charging and unlinking would reduce combined electric- and vehicle-sector CO2 emissions by 27% and reduce gasoline consumption by 59% for $40/vehicle-year more than the reference case. Coordinating EV adoption with adoption of controlled charging, unlinked fuel economy regulations, and renewable electricity standards would provide low-cost reductions in emissions and fuel usage.

The underlying drivers for these long-term trends were examined by performing source apportionment on eleven years (19982008) of data for seven monitoring sites in the Hong Kong PM10 chemical speciation network. Nine factors were resolved using Positive Matrix Factorization. These factors were assigned to emission source categories that were classified as local (operationally defined as within the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) or non-local based on temporal and spatial patterns in the source contribution estimates. This data-driven analysis provides strong evidence that local controls on motor vehicle emissions have been effective in reducing motor vehicle-related ambient PM10 burdens with annual-average contributions at neighborhood- and larger-scale monitoring stations decreasing by 6 g m3 over the eleven year period. However, this improvement has been offset by an increase in annual-average contributions from non-local contributions, especially secondary sulfate and nitrate, of 8 g m3 over the same time period. As a result, non-local source contributions to urban-scale PM10 have increased from 58% in 1998 to 70% in 2008. Most of the motor vehicle-related decrease and non-local source driven increase occurred over the period 19982004 with more modest changes thereafter. Non-local contributions increased most dramatically for secondary sulfate and secondary nitrate factors and thus combustion-related control strategies, including but not limited to power plants, are needed for sources located in the Pearl River Delta and more distant regions to improve air quality conditions in Hong Kong. PMF-resolved source contribution estimates were also used to examine differential contributions of emission source categories during high PM episodes compared to study-average behavior. While contributions from all source categories increased to some extent on high PM days, the increases were disproportionately high for the non-local sources. Thus, controls on emission sources located outside the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be needed to effectively decrease the frequency and severity of high PM episodes.

This study established a multi-year emission inventory for vehicles in Guangzhou during 20052009 and estimated the uncertainty in total vehicle emissions by taking the assumed uncertainties in fleet-average emission factors and annual mileage into account. In 2009, the estimated total vehicle emissions in Guangzhou were 313 000 (242 000387 000) tons of CO, 60 900 (54 00070 200) tons of THC, 65 600 (56 80074 100) tons of NO x  and 2740 (21003400) tons of PM10. Vehicle emissions within the urban area of Guangzhou were estimated to be responsible for 40% of total gaseous pollutants and 25% of total PM10 in the entire city. Although vehicle use intensity increased rapidly in Guangzhou during 20052009, vehicle emissions were estimated to have been reduced by 12% for CO, 21% for THC and 20% for PM10 relative to those in 2005. NO x  emissions were estimated to have remained almost constant during this period. Compared to the without control scenario, 19% (15%23%) of CO, 20% (18%23%) of THC, 9% (8%10%) of NO x  and 16% (12%20%) of PM10 were estimated to have been mitigated from a combination of the implementation of Euro III standards for light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and improvement of fuel quality. This study also evaluated several enhanced vehicle emission control actions taken recently. For example, the enhanced I/M program for LDVs was estimated to reduce 11% (9%14%) of CO, 9% (8%10%) of THC and 2% (2%3%) of NO x  relative to total vehicle emissions in 2009. Total emission reductions by temporary traffic controls for the Asian Games were estimated equivalent to 9% (7%11%) of CO, 9% (8%10%) of THC, 5% (5%6%) of NO x  and 10% (8%13%) of PM10 estimated total vehicle emissions in 2009. Those controls are essential to further vehicle emission mitigation in Guangzhou required by the new National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

Higher average concentrations of n-alkanes and PAHs occurred in the nighttime, presumably due to a restriction on motor vehicle operation during the day and the accumulation of pollutants due to temperature inversions at night. The carbon preference index, contributions of wax n-alkanes, and PAHs diagnostic ratios indicated that the main sources of n-alkanes and PAHs were anthropogenic, especially motor vehicle emissions. The CMAQ model was used to estimate the percentages of biogenic organic aerosol in the total organic aerosol, then the ratios of source marker PAHs to biogenic organic carbon were used to evaluate the air pollution control policies effectiveness during the Asian Games.

Twelve Euro 35 light-duty diesel vehicles (LDDVs) manufactured in Korea were driven on a chassis dynamometer over the standard New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and a representative Korean on-road driving cycle (KDC). NOx emissions, average speeds and accelerations were calculated for each 1-km trip segment, so called averaging windows. The results suggest that the NOx emissions of the tested vehicles are more susceptible to variations in the driving cycles than to those in the operating conditions. Even under comparable operating conditions, the NOx control capabilities of vehicles differ from each other, i.e., NOx control is weaker for the KDC than for the NEDC. The NOx emissions over the KDC for given vehicle operating conditions exceed those over the NEDC by more than a factor of 8. Consequently, on-road NOx emission factors are estimated here to exceed the Euro 5 emission limit by up to a factor of 8, 4 and 3 for typical Korean urban, rural, and motorway road traffic conditions, respectively. Our findings support the development of technical regulations for supplementary real-world emission tests for emission certification and the corresponding research actions taken by automotive industries.

The reconstructed mass concentrations from six sources matched the observations, and the resolved sources constituted 98.91% of the PM2.5 mass concentrations. Secondary sources, the major source contributor, accounted for 55.15% of PM2.5 mass concentration, while several other sources, including coal burning (20.98%), soil dust (9.30%), motor vehicles (6.06%), biomass burning (4.55%), and industry (2.87%), contributed a total of 43.76%. The non-carcinogenic risk estimates showed the elemental risk for Mn, Co, S and Cr were high, with values larger than 0.1 being observed for the three groups. The total elemental risk in Jinan for the three groups was higher than 1, and the largest risk was present for children between the age of 612 followed by that for children between 2 and 6 years of age, indicating that citizens in Jinan, particularly children, faced more serious potential non-carcinogenic health risks.

Given the growing importance of cold start emissions with respect to motor vehicle emission inventories, it is essential to use accurate cold start emission factors for Australian conditions. This paper presents and discusses the approach that was taken to create cold start emission factor for COPERT Australia, a new software for Australian conditions. The method is based on an analysis of empirical Australian data, a literature review and a sensitivity analysis using four possible methods (phase detection functions). The method used in COPERT Australia combines empirical cold start emission profiles with a trip distance distribution to create technology specific cold start emission factors. Finally, these emission factors are used to create a first-order emissions inventory for South East Queensland using output data from a macroscopic transport model. It is estimated that cold start emissions make up a substantial part of air pollutant emissions with cold start to hot running emission ratios of about 0.10 (NOx), 0.50 (CO) and 0.80 (HC).

A detailed analysis of the electricity mix was performed, based on the contribution of each type of primary energy source and their variation along a year. Three mixes were considered, with different life cycle GHG intensity: one mainly based in fossil sources, a second one with a large contribution from nuclear and a third one with a significant share of renewable energy sources. The conventional vehicle technology is represented by gasoline and diesel International Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs), while the electric technology is represented by Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). Real world tests were performed for representative compact and sub-compact EVs. The use profile of the vehicle was based on data acquired by a real time data acquisition system installed in the vehicles. The results show that a mix with a large contribution from Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) does not always translate directly into low GHG emissions for EVs due to the high variability of these sources. The driving profile under different scenarios was also analyzed, showing that an aggressive style can increase the energy consumption by 47%. The tests also showed that the use of climate control can increase the energy consumption between 24 and 60%. Compared with other technologies, EVs can be more sustainable from an environmental and economic perspective; however, three main factors are required: improvement of battery technology, an eco-driving attitude and an environmental friendly electricity mix.

This paper presents a policy discussion and policy recommendations on a number of topics related to the regulation and incentives for fuel electricity within the LCFS. In the near-term, the LCFS will have a limited role in incentivizing the use of electricity and lowering the carbon intensity of electricity, and electricity will play a small role in meeting LCFS targets. Calculating a carbon intensity value for electricity is a complex process, requiring many decisions and trade-offs to be made, including allocation methods, system boundaries, temporal resolution and how to treat electricity demand for vehicle charging. These choices along with other regulatory decisions about who can obtain LCFS credits will influence the incentives for providing electricity and charging infrastructure relative to other low-carbon fuels as well as across different electricity providers. The paper discusses how fuel electricity would fit into an LCFS, identifying those special characteristics that could reduce the effectiveness of the policy. It also provides specific recommendations to enable better policy design that appropriately incentivizes the use of low-carbon fuels.

This means that European policies targeting specific  sometimes relatively costly  technologies, such as electric cars and advanced insulation measures, are usually not evaluated as part of cost-optimal scenarios. This study explores an emission mitigation scenario for Europe up to 2050, taking as a starting point specific emission reduction options instead of a carbon tax. The purpose is to identify the potential of each of these policies and identify trade-offs between sectoral policies in achieving emission reduction targets. The reduction options evaluated in this paper together lead to a reduction of 65% of 1990 CO2-equivalent emissions by 2050. More bottom-up modelling exercises, like the one presented here, provide a promising starting point to evaluate policy options that are currently considered by policy makers.

Moreover, the rapid development of power electronics technologies has even realized high energy-efficient vehicles. EV could be the alternative to decrease the global green house gases emission as the energy consumption in the world transportation is high. However, EV faces huge challenges in battery cost since one-third of the EV cost lies on battery. This paper reviews state-of-the-art of the energy sources, storage devices, power converters, low-level control energy management strategies and high supervisor control algorithms used in EV. The comparison on advantages and disadvantages of vehicle technology is highlighted. In addition, the standards and patterns of drive cycles for EV are also outlined. The advancement of power electronics and power processors has enabled sophisticated controls (low-level and high supervisory algorithms) to be implemented in EV to achieve optimum performance as well as the realization of fast-charging stations. The rapid growth of EV has led to the integration of alternative resources to the utility grid and hence smart grid control plays an important role in managing the demand. The awareness of environmental issue and fuel crisis has brought up the sales of EV worldwide.

Although eco-nomic recession in the early 1990s was a driver in the de-crease of air pollution by industry, the sharp growth in the use of private cars has made transport an increasingly im-portant contributor in air and noise pollution problems, especially in major cities. Leptokaria is a modern Greek city in Pieria prefecture, Central Macedonia which lies on the coast of Aegean Sea, under the Mount Olympos. The atmospheric pollution in an urban environment poses a serious problem, since the joint consequences of vehicle emissions and traffic noise affect dramatically the physi-cal and mental health of the citizens as well as the quality of life and services. In this paper, exhaust gas data from spark ignition (SI) engine vehicles were taken with inter-seasonal measurements by monitoring the tailpipe gases. In particular: CO, C02, 02, and HC were measured both at idle and 2000 rpm. In addition, sensory observations on the qualitative noise, optic and nasal evaluation of the opera-tion of gasoline engine vehicles were carried out, as well as controls of possession of exhaust gas cards. Furthermore, a novel emission control process has been proposed and pre-sented for the detection of gross polluting vehicles. Based on these data, the main result that has been found is that in Leptokaria there is 1 vehicle which pollutes as much as the rest of 4 vehicles, simultaneously.

We employ a CSIRO process-based model of the physical activity of Australias economy and environmental resources, the Australian Stocks and Flows Framework. The RE systems are assumed to be manufactured in Australia to identify possible employment benefits. In comparison with the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, on a national scale, the RE scenario has much lower economy-wide net emissions, remaining below contemporary levels and becoming zero in the electricity sector by 2060. Compared with BAU, the RE scenario also has significantly lower industrial water use, somewhat higher materials use, slightly lower unemployment, lower net foreign debt (relative to a GDP proxy) and, resulting from the growth in electric vehicles, reduced oil imports. The GDP per capita growth, based on the physical stocks of capital and labour, is virtually the same in both scenarios. Hence, from the viewpoint of the biophysical economy, there are no major barriers to implementing policies to facilitate the transition to a 100% renewable electricity system for Australia.

Mass adoption of EVs will have a number of impacts and benefits, including the ability to assist in the integration of renewable energy into existing electric grids. This paper reviews the current literature on EVs, the electric grid, and renewable energy integration. Key methods and assumptions of the literature are discussed. The economic, environmental and grid impacts of EVs are reviewed. Numerous studies assessing the ability of EVs to integrate renewable energy sources are assessed; the literature indicates that EVs can significantly reduce the amount of excess renewable energy produced in an electric system. Studies on windEV interaction are much more detailed than those on solar photovoltaics (PV) and EVs. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research.

China. We examine fuel-cycle emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), PM2.5, PM10, NOx, and SO2 of CNGVs and EVs relative to gasoline ICEVs and hybrids, by Chinese province. CNGVs can currently reduce emissions of GHGs, PM10, PM2.5, NOx, and SO2 by approximately 6%, 7%, 20%, 18% and 22%, respectively. EVs can reduce GHG emissions by 20%, but increase PM10, PM2.5, NOx, and SO2 emissions by approximately 360%, 250%, 120%, and 370%, respectively. Nevertheless, results vary significantly by province. Regarding their contribution to national emissions, PM increases from EVs are unimportant, because light-duty passenger vehicles contribute very little to overall PM emissions nationwide (=0.05%); however, their NOx and SO2 increases are important. Since China is striving to reduce power plant emissions, EVs are expected to have equivalent or even lower SO2 and NOx emissions relative to ICEVs in the future (2030). Before then, however, EVs should be developed according to the cleanness of regional power mixes. This would lower their SO2 and NOx emissions and earn more GHG reduction credits.

Leveraging the intrinsic energy storage potential of certain electric loads could be the key for an efficient transition to green power generation. Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are about to be introduced on a large scale. In this paper, we investigate the savings potential of electricity retailers resulting from the ability to control the charging behavior of a fleet of PEVs using Information and Communication Technology (ICT). This savings potential is important as it could jumpstart the development of advanced control infrastructures for dynamic demand side management. The paper makes three major contributions: first, it applies a novel car usage model based on data from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). Second, it develops and evaluates several charging scheduling algorithms with low computational requirements. Third, it identifies several key parameters influencing the relative and absolute savings potential of ICT-controlled PEV charging. We obtain a relative savings potential of up to 45%. The absolute yearly savings per PEV, however, are rather small, which could limit the economic incentives of electricity retailers to deploy the required infrastructure.

To address the energy security and urban air-pollution concerns that emerge from rapid vehicle population growth, China has initiated the Thousands of Vehicles, Tens of Cities (TVTC) Program to accelerate the new energy vehicle (NEV) commercialization. In this paper, we summarize the efforts made by the Chinese government since 1995 in the areas of research and development, demonstration, and communalization of NEVs; evaluate the progress of NEV demonstration; and provide some recommendations for future development. Our analysis has determined that the deployment of NEVs for the TVTC Program is lagging behind the original plan and, on average, only 26-36% of the goals have been attained by October 2011. Although China has approved many NEV models for sale, significantly more than 50% of them are not in production. On the other hand, stimulated by the policy shift, electric vehicle production has increased considerably, thereby contributing 23% and 44% of the total NEV production in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Additionally, because of the constraints imposed by price and technology maturity, lead-acid battery technology is a substantial factor in the high-volume sales of top NEV car models.

Traffic emission models are used to estimate and predict vehicle fleet emissions and the air quality of countries, regions, cities, etc. In addition to the statistical input of fleet activities, these models are mostly based on the use of separate emission sub-models for hot driving and cold start driving. In reality, the cold start models are almost entirely empirical and of limited accuracy. In this work, a model is developed that is based on physical reasoning, i.e., it is based on energy balances. Because many details, such as the thermal conductivities and the engine control decisions, are unknown, the model must be able to address different simplifications. The model can be parameterized with as few as two tests per vehicle. It is applied to several car samples (six to eight vehicles each) of different technical generations and shows reliable prediction for any combination of the driving pattern (including gradient), the ambient temperature, the stop time before the ride and the duration of the ride (if shorter than the warm-up phase).

The advantage of SR-XAS is that samples do not undergo any chemical treatment prior to measurements, thus excluding possible alterations. These analyses revealed that the samples of wheel rims dust, road dust, and atmospheric particulate matter are composed by an admixture of Sb(III) and Sb(V) in different relative abundances. Brake linings turned out to be composed by Sb(III) oxide (Sb2O3) and stibnite (Sb2S3). Stibnite was also detected in some of the particulate matter samples. The obtained data suggest that Sb2S3 during the brake abrasion process is easily decomposed forming more stable compounds such as antimony mixed oxidic forms. Sb redox speciation, in particular and well studied circumstances, may enhance the potential and selectivity of this element as a tracer of motor vehicle emissions in apportioning studies.
